<h2>Study Applied Bioinformatics at Cranfield</h2>
Over the past few years, bioinformatics has become the most exciting field in biology. This MSc course provides a unique hands-on learning experience in bioinformatics skills, by combining the latest advances in analysing high-throughput genomic, transcriptomic and metabolomics data.
Cranfield’s Bioinformatics MSc is the first of its kind in the UK. With more than 200 alumni over the past 10 years, it became the most popular postgraduate course in bioinformatics in Europe. Because Cranfield is a solely postgraduate university it means that every single taught module of the Applied Bioinformatics MSc is uniquely tailored to be master's level. That’s why it is the winner of the BBSRC’s Master's Training Grant (MTG) award for the best course in life sciences. Our taught modules cover in great depth a plethora of programming languages typically applied in bioinformatics, such as Perl, Java, R and SQL, as well as modern web technologies, such as JavaEE, NoSQL and JavaScript. Furthermore, we have two dedicated taught modules focusing on established bioinformatics protocols for the latest next generation sequencing (NGS) and 3rd generation sequencing (3GS) technologies.            </div>

                                <p>Water bodies are fundamental features of the landscape. Whether they are rivers, canals, wetlands, ponds, lakes, estuaries or the open coast, they are important habitats that support diverse ecological communities and provide essential services to society. Therefore, countries have developed regulations to protect the quality of these water bodies and methods to assess status. Around the world, quality is increasingly being assessed based on a wide set of physical, chemical and biological attributes of the water body. In the UK, quality is assessed based on its ecological and chemical quality under the Water Framework Directive (WFD), which became part of UK law in 2003. This module will provide you with an overview of WFD and other relevant water quality regulation and policy that govern the management and assessment of surface waters. It will also provide you with a background in ecological processes, aquatic communities, and survey design and data analysis to help those working in environmental water management to interpret water quality data in the context of the catchment characteristics and pressures.</p>

                                <div>There is a growing recognition that sustainable solutions to environmental water management problems require a coordinated approach. With climate change, aging infrastructure, and an increasing human population growth with its increased demand for urban development, food and water, we require creative and effective policy, management and technological solutions that address multiple problems and increase the resilience of our natural, economic and social systems. In this module, you will develop the skills to critically evaluate and analyse environmental data and information in a spatial context and to assess them in light of current drivers (e.g. regulatory and socioeconomic) to develop integrated solutions for water supply, wastewater treatment, water quality, flooding, conservation of aquatic ecosystems, etc.</div>

                                <div>Extreme weather events are considered top global risks. Every year, many places around the world are affected by droughts and floods leading to severe impacts on people, the environment, agricultural and industrial production, and water supply infrastructure. Climate change will increase the frequency and severity of these natural hazards. Thus, we need to improve our ability to characterise and understand their occurrence, duration and intensity; and to effectively implement management responses to reduce vulnerability and minimise their impacts. This module will focus on droughts and floods, covering their definition, forecasting, impacts and management options. The module focuses on impact and management responses in three key sectors – domestic, businesses and the environment. </div>

                                <span>Environmental impact assessment and economic feasibility assessment are important tools for detailed evaluation of complex engineering processes and innovative process concepts, which aim to tackle global challenges. The tools and concepts taught in this module will enable process engineers to assess the sustainability of the process plant designs from environmental and economic standpoints. Tools such as net present value (NPV) assessment and life cycle assessment (LCA) are becoming widely applied in the industry to ensure sustainability of their assets over their lifetime. This module aims to introduce you to the modern techniques for economic and environmental assessment of sustainable process systems. It comprises several hands-on case studies (microprojects) that enable you to develop relevant economic and environmental impact assessment competencies via hands-on experience using commercial software. You will also work on an industrially relevant case study that will take you through the entire process assessment process. You will also learn how to account for uncertainty and apply reduced-order models.  </span>

                                <p>A crucial competence for marketers is marketing strategy: in simple terms, analysing how the target market divides into segments, which of these segments are key targets for the firm, what the firm’s value proposition to each segment is, and what financial results can be expected over a planning period of typically 1-3 years. This module teaches Cranfield’s world-leading step-by-step process for developing such a marketing strategy and documenting it in a marketing plan. This process has been developed with hundreds of blue-chip companies worldwide over the last 30 years, informed by several Cranfield PhDs on the topic which have studied what works in practice. It is documented in the world’s leading textbook on the topic, McDonald &amp; Wilson’s Marketing Plans, which has sold over half a million copies. This book is used as the course text and you are strongly advised to buy your own copy, to help bridge from the course to planning for real in your subsequent management roles.</p>
<p>Being able to define or refine a marketing strategy underpins all other aspects of marketing which help to make this strategy happen. For example, the firm’s brand or brands need to be aligned with the value proposition, as do marketing communications. To help students integrate learning across these different marketing disciplines, this module is assessed through an integrated assignment alongside Marketing Consulting Project and Accounting and Finance for Strategic Marketing.</p>

                                <p>The <em>sales</em> function has an increasing strategic role in companies, due to the high concentration of distribution channels, a growing competitive environment, and the opportunities to obtain market information, among other trends. In fact, <em>sales</em> is considered not only a function, but also a process, where the internal coordination and alignment become crucial to achieve sustained sales performance. </p>
<p>The purpose of this module is to provide you with concepts and tools that are critical for relationship selling and sales management. The focus of the module is on business-to-business (B2B) relationships with customers, and it should benefit executives who work in sales, either selling directly to customers or leading salespeople. It should also be valuable for those involved in general management, marketing, and other functional areas in the organisation.       </p>

                                <p>It is evident to most organisations that customers represent a true “asset” in that they have the potential to generate revenues and other benefits to the supplier company. Customers represent one of the main stakeholders of a company, in addition to the owners, the employees, the suppliers, and the society as a whole. A good understanding of customers is therefore vital. Moreover, business-to-business (B2B) buyer-supplier relationships have been found to be an important source of differentiation and competitive advantage if supplier companies are able to engage in those relationships properly.</p>
<p>The purpose of this module is to provide you with concepts and tools that are critical for B2B customer management. It should benefit executives who are involved in buyer-supplier interactions and relationships, and those involved in general management, marketing, and other functional areas in the organisation.</p>

                                <p>In many businesses, from consumer goods to industrial services, the primary assets are increasingly intangible. First amongst these is the brand, whether this consists of a portfolio of branded businesses or the corporate brand itself. In both instances, the brand asset needs to be managed to build customer loyalty and resourced so that the competitive advantage it generates can be sustained.</p>
<p>Similarly, one way the equity that lies in the brand can be leveraged is by appropriately extending the brand. Managing the brand, therefore, requires insights into brand preferences and repeat purchasing patterns. It also requires a clear understanding of the levers of successful brand strategies and the tenets of managing brands in the new digital world. The course covers each of these aspects, and brand management is discussed both in a national and international context.</p>

You will also learn a critical appreciation of their applicability within different scenarios and contexts. This technical competence must be deployed with due consideration to the benefits of improved services and a cleaner environment including public health improvement, quality of life, convenience, dignity and personal safety. The vital importance of human behaviour and behaviour change must also be considered within the context of hygiene, ending unsanitary practices such as open defecation, and the creation of demand and willingness to pay for a more sanitary environment.</p>
<p>This module is 20 credits.</p>

<p class=""Creditform"">The combined pressures of climate change, population growth and urbanisation create a demand for transformation in the relationship between development and resilience. As proposed in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Sendai Framework, there is a need to embed resilience within public, private and community planning so to support sustainable services and livelihoods in this era of rapid change. While there is no widely accepted definition, the concept of resilience implies both long-term thinking, to better anticipate and plan for emerging challenges, and the ability to deal with near-term (and potentially unexpected) shocks and disruptions. Achieving this ambition creates significant challenges for water, wastewater/sanitation and hygiene in terms of how to supply growing populations (in planned and/or unplanned settlements); how to plan new, and manage ageing, infrastructure; how to interact with the natural environment; and how to deal with the increasing frequency and severity of disruptive events and the growing uncertainty surrounding them. This module will examine these challenges and provide you with the skills to identify, contextualise and evaluate different management strategies and approaches. </p>

A lecture approach and case evaluations will be used to present theory and practice, with emphasis on pragmatic techniques to evaluate and improve performance.  Cases will be used to explore interaction between the taught concepts and to develop greater understanding of how operations performance can be improved.  Specific areas that will be covered include: <br>
•	Objective, principles, terminology and systems of management accounting. <br>
•	Inter-relationships between functional responsibilities within a company<br>
•	Performance measurement<br>
•	Evaluation of potential improvement actions<br>
•	Developing an improvement plan<br>

                                <p>This module brings together theoretical and computational stress analysis through finite element simulations, allowing you to appreciate how the two disciplines interact in practice and what their strengths and limitations are. The examination of finite element analysis (FEA) for various practical applications (e.g. engineering components, composite structures, rotating disks, cracked geometries) in conjunction with relevant case studies will allow you to combine theoretical understanding with practical experience, to develop your skills to model and analyse complex engineering problems.</p>

Both for the developed and developing economies challenges stem from meeting increasing electricity demands from more intermittent renewable resources. This module covers a variety of theoretical and empirical topics related to energy demand, energy supply, energy prices, renewable vs depletable resources and environmental consequences of energy consumption and production, all from an economic perspective. It will demonstrate how key economic principles are used in various energy-environment models to inform energy and climate policy.</span><br>

                                Object oriented programming (OOP) is the standard programming methodology used in nearly all fields of major software construction today, including engineering and science and C++ is one of the most heavily employed languages. OOP using C++ is also needed in a number of software tools, such as OpenCV in Machine Vision for Robotics or ROS in Digital Robotics, in order to program specific modules and further enhance their associated functionality. This module aims to answer the question ‘what is OOP’ and to provide the students with the understanding and skills necessary to write well designed and robust OO programs in C++. Students will learn how to write C++ code, starting from fundamental programming aspects and progressing through to advanced OOP. Hands-on programming sessions form an essential part of the module.<br>

                                Human-robot interaction (HRI) is a relatively new topic that has gained popularity in recent years due to updates in safety legislations and advancement in interactive and collaborative technology. Human-robot interaction is becoming more common in social and domestic settings, and human-robot collaborative systems could be the solution to numerous industrial problems. However, the HRI must be designed appropriately to ensure high-level of usesability and seamless interaction. The aim of this module is to introduce students to human-robot interaction design and technology, and their applications. Students will learn about natural user interface and its applications in interaction. There will be opportunities to experience and practice hands-on programming of industrial collaborative robots to carry out basis tasks.<br>

                                The most powerful method of sensing available to humans is vision. In computing and robotics visual information is represented as a digital image. In order to process visual information in computer systems we need to know about processing digital images. By processing visual information we can develop automated visual interpretation and understanding – artificial vision, itself a large part of wider field of the Artificial Intelligence. In order to achieve this we must be able to extract high-level visual information such as edges and regions from images and additionally allow for the efficient storage of large amounts of visual data which can then be used in robotics applications.<br>

                                As robots and robotic devices are increasingly becoming part of our day-to-day lives it is vital that we know how to effectively integrate them with people new advanced systems. This module explores the changing landscape of robotics in society and how we comply with evolving demands and perspectives of ethics and safety standards. With a focus on fundamental human factors and psychological principles we examine how to optimise the integration of people with different types of robotic systems and environments. Students will be given the opportunity to apply practical human analysis tools and techniques that complement traditional engineering approaches to enhance usability and performance in the design of safe human-robot interaction.<br>

            <p>The MSc in Robotics is designed to equip you with the skills required to pursue a successful career working in the UK and overseas.</p>
<p>The International Federation of Robotics’ Executive Summary report shows that the deployment of industrial robots has constantly increased in the last decade and it is predicted that global robot installations will increase by at least 15% annually in the next three years. Mike Wilson, the President of British Automation and Robot Association, has highlighted that robotics is one of the key technologies in ensuring the UK’s manufacturing can be as competitive and productive as possible, and the UK needs to address skill pipeline issues in order to meet the skills that are required by the industry going forward. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the mechanical engineering field - which includes robotics engineers - was projected to experience 5% employment growth over ten years to 2022. It is important to recognise these increasing needs which will lead to a high demand for highly trained robotic engineers.</p>

People are depending more upon their own initiative to realise success. Never, it seems, have more people been starting their own companies than now, particularly to exploit the World Wide Web. There’s no single Government (in either the developed or the developing world), which is not paying at least lip service to enterprise development. The aim of this module is to provide you with knowledge and skills relevant for starting and managing new ventures across the entrepreneurial life cycle. Moreover, it will prepare you on how to prepare a business pitch to an investor.</span></p>

Both for the developed and developing economies challenges stem from meeting increasing electricity demands from more intermittent renewable resources. This module covers a variety of theoretical and empirical topics related to energy demand, energy supply, energy prices, renewable vs depletable resources and environmental consequences of energy consumption and production, all from an economic perspective. It will demonstrate how key economic principles are used in various energy-environment models to inform energy and climate policy.</span><br>

People are depending more upon their own initiative to realise success. Never, it seems, have more people been starting their own companies than now, particularly to exploit the World Wide Web. There’s no single Government (in either the developed or the developing world), which is not paying at least lip service to enterprise development. The aim of this module is to provide you with knowledge and skills relevant for starting and managing new ventures across the entrepreneurial life cycle. Moreover, it will prepare you on how to prepare a business pitch to an investor.</span></p>

                                <p>Managerial decisions in logistics and supply chain management are heavily based on quantitative analysis using models from the management science discipline. Data, models, and available software have dramatically changed the operations in manufacturing, services, and logistics sectors. The module aims to provide students with an introduction to the role and the relevance of analytical techniques in logistics and supply chain management.</p>
<p>From simple graphs to deterministic and stochastic optimisation models, it offers transferable skills to use associated techniques for the practice of these disciplines. Students will develop the ability to model and solve realistic decision problems in the context of logistics and supply chain management. This process will be facilitated by spreadsheet-based software packages where the students will have an opportunity to build their own spreadsheet models with emphasis on appropriate application of methods and interpretation of model outputs.</p>

                                <p>The Freight Transport module provides a sound foundation in road, rail, air and sea freight transport.  The focus is primarily from a user perspective in order to provide a logistics and supply chain management viewpoint.  However, in road freight, the module also covers more detailed fleet management and operational aspects, recognising that many organisations operate their own road transport fleets but also reflecting the importance of road freight as the primary inland freight mode in most geographies for national and urban freight traffic.</p>

                                <p>This is an introduction to the subject. However, it is our contention that projects are the building blocks of strategy. Also, the module provides a logical and simple process by which students may approach their own modules and objectives, and may well be a valuable source of confidence for taking on major elective projects later in the year.</p>
<p>Project Management Introduction (PMI) demonstrates how management respects no boundaries (either in terms of functional silos – departments, etc. or theoretical disciplines). PMI provides additional opportunities to practice personal communication skills, and generally the module provides a basis for personal development and increased confidence and self-awareness.</p>

                                <p><span>Today, a considerable part of the organisations’ turnover is assigned to purchasing goods and services. With so much of an organisation’s money on the line, and increasing reliance on external resources and outsourcing, suppliers are of great importance for the buying companies and have a crucial role for their success. Hence, buying organisations need to make strategic decisions on selecting the right suppliers with the right competences and performance. Supplier selection is the process by which the buyer identifies, evaluates, contracts with, and monitors suppliers.</span></p>
<p>This module aims to introduce the supplier selection process, and to discuss its elements and implications. The module demonstrates strategic and operational perspectives to supplier selection, and rationalise the multiple dimensions of supplier selection and evaluation decisions. Different approaches to supplier selection are presented and various decision-making techniques are reviewed. Various supplier selection criteria and evaluation factors from different sectors are also introduced.</p>
<p>By the end of this module, students should have a clear understanding of supplier selection processes, be knowledgeable of supplier selection and evaluation criteria, and be able to develop the relevant decision-making models in sourcing and procurements contexts. This module is also distinctive because it provides students with the opportunity to experience the application of many management science techniques in one of the most crucial functions of procurement and supply chain management.</p>

                                <p style=""text-align: left;"">Performance measurement and management (PMM) has been on the agenda of both academics and practitioners in both private and public sectors for several decades. However, despite the substantial resources invested in PMM by organisations, research shows that PMM-related initiatives, such as the implementation of scorecards or the adoption of PM procedures, can often fail to bring the intended benefits. Moreover, sometimes they turn out to be detrimental to the performance of the organisation!<span style=""font-weight: lighter;""> </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">If organisations are to realise value and become more sustainable in the longer term, it is crucial to understand <em>how</em> <em>exactly</em> performance measurement and management practices deliver improved performance. Even more, when several interconnected organisations form a part of a supply network, the measurement task is particularly complicated. Does performance measurement in supply networks deserve special treatment? Do the general principles of organisational performance management still apply? These are some of the questions the module will address.<span style=""font-weight: lighter; text-align: left;""> </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">This module will focus on the types and structures of performance measurement systems such as the Balanced Scorecard and the Performance Prism and on the design of appropriate strategy and success maps, performance targets, and indicators.</p>

                                <p><span>The main thrust of this elective is that organisations can and should develop supply chain resilience as means to building routines for non-routine events. In today’s interconnected world future supply chain professionals have to recognise potential risks of experiencing a supply chain disruption and be able to prepare for, react to and recover from the unforeseen supply chains, i.e. to develop resilience. This module explores the dimensions, approaches, decision-making and causalities of resilience. Insights from retrospective and real time case studies will provide the basis for understanding the vulnerability of today’s global supply chains. Moreover, they will enable you to experiment both with the perspectives of supply chain planners anticipating supply chain risks and improving the resilience of the supply chain design and supply chain continuity managers responsible for ensuring rapid recovery after a disruptive event.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">The overall aim of this elective is to provide you with a good appreciation of the application, strengths and weaknesses of simulation modelling techniques and the software that can be used to support decision-making in logistics and supply chain management.  You will gain hands-on experience of using spreadsheet models including the use of specialist simulation add-ins and general purpose simulation software to solve decision problems in a specific supply chain management context.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">By the end of this module you will have the skills and confidence to apply or recommend the use of simulation methods to address decision problems in your future career and, if needed, in your thesis project.</p>

Various market structures and alternative explanations of firms’ objectives are explored as well as the issues that determine them.  <br>
<br>
4. The ways in which owners seek to ensure their interests are paramount and the ways in which internal control and reward systems deliver efficiency. The purpose is to integrate organisational and economic theory in order to explain why the rate at which firms grow and profitability vary.   <br>
<br>
5. Capturing value from the market<br>
<br>
6. Examines the strategic behaviour of firms influenced by alternative market structures.  Market structures and market power are related concepts and this section of the module largely focuses on oligopolistic markets and the behaviours such firms engage in to achieve competitive advantage.   <br>
<br>
7. Markets for capital and natural resources.<br>
<br>
8. Throughout the module traditional microeconomic models are combined with game theory and reality is further enhanced by an emphasis on uncertainty and the role of governments.   <br>

    <li>The main aim of this module is to help tomorrow’s business leaders develop a deeper understanding of the impact of developments in the wider macroeconomic environment – at the national and international levels – on strategic planning and management.
    </li>
    <li>A deep and critical understanding of the macroeconomy is essential to the formulation of effective corporate strategies particularly in the context of a rapidly changing and challenging global economic and business environment.
    </li>
    <li>Business decisions are not taken in a vacuum. Arguably one of the most important influences on corporate leaders at the highest levels is their assessment of the external economic and business environment. Successful business leaders understand how key macroeconomic variables, such as economic growth, earnings, unemployment and inflation, are likely to impact on the markets their businesses serve. The traditional view is that the external environment is largely driven by domestic government fiscal and monetary policies. But increasingly it is external influences at the international level such as global trade and international capital flows that drive the world economy and force reactive policies from nation state governments – with direct and indirect consequences for strategic decisions by leadership in both the private and public sectors.
    </li>
    <li>The module places particular emphasis some of the latest developments and perspectives at the macroeconomy level that now dominate policies and business in an international context – including topics such as: the recent global financial crisis and the importance of global competition; international trade relationships; currency movements and business cycles. This module will provide an opportunity to discuss the causes and consequences of macroeconomic developments and policies, nationally and internationally, in order to deepen understanding of the consequences for governments, society and the corporate world. </li>

<p><span style=""color: black;"">Throughout, the emphasis is on the “real world” – theory is included only as an aid to developing a deeper understanding of the practical problems and policy challenges in the context of strategy formulation and analysis of the forces driving change in the external business and economic environment.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: black;"">The first set of sessions serve as a foundation, explaining:  how economic activity is measured and interpreted;  the main macroeconomic flows;  what determines the level and changes in national income as well as the meaning of inflationary and deflationary gaps.  The following sessions focus on management of the domestic economy including fiscal policy, monetary policy, economic growth and supply-side policies. International aspects of the macroeconomy are then examined in detail covering:  the balance of payments account, trade policy, exchange-rate regimes and the various exchange-rate policy choices available to countries.  The final session brings together the core concepts and explains the causes of business cycles.</span></p>

The rest of the week is devoted to hosted visits to commercial and public sector organisations, during the days and a number of additional events such as meetings with journalists, politicians and alumni during the evenings. The hosted visits normally involve a presentation by senior officials and possibly a tour of facilities.

                                <p>Leadership is a central concept and practice in organisations. However what leadership is and
what leaders do is subject to intense debate. Traditionally leadership has been seen as tripod of
leaders, followers and shared goals and leadership was developed through introspection. In this
module leadership will be conceptualised as an outcome of direction, alignment and commitment
and will be developed through outsight by practising leadership in different settings and contexts.
This module explores how leadership can be developed through practice. It does so by using a
blend of research-based insights and experiential teaching methods. Learners are developed as
resourceful stewards of leadership.</p>

The objective is to introduce users to the terminology, basic numerical and mathematical aspects of the method. This should help students to avoid some of the more common and important user errors, many of which stem from a ""black box"" approach to this technique. Some basic guidelines are also given on how to approach the modelling of structures using the Finite Element Method.  </p>

This module teaches Cranfield’s world-leading step-by-step process for developing such a marketing strategy and documenting it in a marketing plan. This process has been developed with hundreds of blue-chip companies worldwide over the last 30 years, informed by several Cranfield PhDs on the topic which have studied what works in practice. This planning process  is documented in the world’s leading textbook on the topic, McDonald &amp; Wilson’s Marketing Plans, which has sold over half a million copies. This book is used as the course text and students are strongly advised to acquire a copy from the library or through purchase to help bridge from the course to planning for real in their subsequent management roles.</span></p>

                                <p>Strategic Management is concerned with the direction and scope of the organisation.  This involves determining the purpose of the organisation, establishing objectives and formulating strategies to achieve the objectives. It predominantly explores how an organisation positions itself with regard to its changing environment, and in particular its competitors, in order to gain and sustain competitive advantage. This means that strategic management considers how an organisation’s internal resources and capabilities can be developed to meet the changing demands of customers, in such a way as to achieve the expectations and objectives of its stakeholders.  </p>

                                <p>This module introduces disruptive innovation and sets out why it is a distinctive form of innovation. The core theory underpinning the topic is introduced along with the rationale for adopting a contrasting approach to that used for managing incremental innovation. The module presents a range of practical tools to support organisations in building strategic competences that enable them to recognise, create or react to disruptive innovation. The module reviews how disruptive innovation applies, individually or in combination, to technology, processes, services and business models. </p>
<p>A core element of the module will be a simulation of an innovation project. The project’s aim will be to develop an innovative product that has potential to be disruptive to the existing market. The simulation will involve team-based activities that equip you with practical tools and hands-on experience. The assessment requires a critical reflection on the experience of using various techniques for managing disruptive innovation within the simulation.</p>
<p>During the module the knowledge and skills required for the simulation will be introduced through a combination of lectures, cases studies and other activities. These will introduce both theoretical elements of the module but also practical techniques that can then be applied within the simulation.</p>

</ol>
<p> This module will also develop a potential foundation for a dissertation. A dissertation could draw on the module content to inform the development of an innovation that has been proposed or is currently in development. A dissertation could focus on various aspects of a disruptive innovation, for example, to analyse and understand the relationship between organisational environment and innovation type (disruptive <em>vs.</em> incremental) or to evaluate a set of potential scenarios for development of an innovation.

                                <p>The aim of this module is to familiarise students with the concepts of social enterprise and intrapreneurism, and enable them to compare and contrast these phenomena with “non-traditional” entrepreneurship.  Both business models overlap extensively with what is regarded as traditional entrepreneurship, but have distinctively different features: while being profit-or surplus-making, their aims typically embrace social outcomes and purposes, and their distribution or sharing of value created is frequently closely linked to these declared values.</p>
<p>Students will be introduced to the history and evolution of non-mainstream modes of entrepreneurship and will develop their understanding of how social entrepreneurs/social intrapreneurs and intrapreneurs create and operate enterprises/intrapreneurial activities in different environments.  They will see how such enterprises fit within the spectrum of profit and not for profit entities, and how these are regarded by policy-makers and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>Students will emerge with a clearer idea of whether they would like to make a career in this business environment or, indeed, aspire to found their own social enterprise or pursue a corporate intrapreneurial initiative.</p>

When they don't, family businesses can be difficult to manage, painful experiences at best. The path to success for any business can follow many routes. Family businesses add the complexities of family life to business challenges, expanding the range of issues, personalities, needs and potential solutions for every decision. Knowing something about family types, communication patterns, managerial styles and the amount of support members can expect from their families may be as important to beginning entrepreneurs as knowing how to reach a market or managing cash flow.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The course addresses aspects of managing an established family business, on a day-to-day basis and planning for succession to the next generation: values, life cycles, growth strategies, succession, conflict resolution, governance and cultural change. Family business issues of new companies are a small part of the course content; because there are other modules in the MSc Entrepreneurship and Management programme that concern entrepreneurship and small business management, this module will enable students to run their family businesses in an entrepreneurial manner.</p>

                                <p><span>Corporate entrepreneurship (CE) is a practice of entrepreneurship in established organisations. The module is about (re)configuring existing organisations such that they are able to (continue to) identify, explore and exploit new growth opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span>Corporate entrepreneurship typically refers to a processes, practices and structures whereby an individual or a group of individuals, in association with an established company, (a) create a new organisation (i.e. engage in corporate venturing) or (b) instigate renewal or innovation within the current organisation.</span></p>
<p><span>Engaging into corporate entrepreneurship, be it through corporate venturing or less formalised efforts of identifying new growth opportunities through innovation, strategic renewal or business model reconstruction is key to organisational survival and growth. However, entrepreneurial efforts within existing organisations pose a set of nontrivial management challenges such as:</span></p>
</ul><ol style=""list-style-type: lower-alpha;"">
    <li><span>Would an existing organisation benefit from relying on bold, risk-taking individuals? </span></li>
    <li><span>Is entrepreneurial behaviour consistent with the planned and controlled strategic direction of a company? To which extend would the shareholders be willing to let the management engage heavily into entrepreneurial initiatives?</span></li>
    <li><span>How would established market presence and corporate reputation be affected by the performance of the new initiatives? </span></li>
    <li><span>How can a promising corporate entrepreneurship initiative be executed effectively in the presence:</span></li>
</ol>
<ol style=""list-style-type: lower-roman;"">
    <li><span>the entrepreneurial team’s limited formal power within the organisation;</span></li>
    <li><span>the initiative’s needed to achieve legitimacy; and </span></li>
    <li><span>the need to overcome internal inertia and resistance to change.</span></li>
</ol>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>The aim of this module is to familiarise students with the concepts of corporate entrepreneurship and the way they can be applied to develop entrepreneurial management capabilities within existing organisations. We will examine the organisational architecture – i.e. leadership, culture, structure and strategies - needed to encourage creativity, innovation and the development of sustainable competitive advantage in larger, existing organisations.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>We will focus on the skills and resources needed to promote and manage corporate entrepreneurship process which includes opportunity recognition, establishing internal and external legitimacy of the business concept, managing the implementation process and more broadly, achieving organisational ambidexterity (i.e. the ability to manage existing operations and generate new business effectively).</span></p>

                                <p>Global sustainability challenges are shaping the way business operates in the 21st century. Businesses are under increasing pressure from multiple stakeholders (for e.g. shareholders, customers, employees, society) to manage their positive and negative impacts with clear responsibility and strategic intent.  Leading firms are choosing to respond to these challenges by generating sustainable value propositions to ultimately drive competitive advantage. For many this has meant re-engaging at the level of purpose and re-addressing their role in wider society and for human well-being.</p>
<p>This module outlines the major sustainability challenges and explores the capabilities organisations require to respond positively to them. It will engage you in gaining a better understanding of how corporate action can be best configured to promote responsible and sustainable business strategies. In doing so, it will demand management students (as future business managers and leaders) to reflect on the long-standing debate about whether or not ‘the business of business, is still business?</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">It is rarely an absence of planning that causes organisational difficulties; rather it is the failure of management in understanding and managing complex personal and interpersonal systems that can lead to significant problems.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Similarly an acute and critical understanding of these dynamic relationships can lead to profound and enduring success and benefit for the individual, the team, the organisation and wider society.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">In this module students will be introduced to various aspects of people and organisations.  This module combines models, theories and ideas from organisational behaviour, psychology, and sociology in order to provide students with a basic understanding in recognising, understanding and utilising what has been termed the ""human factor"" in organisations; including ways of conceptualising organisations and how people behave within them.  We shall consider the impact of the external environment; and address notions of organisational change.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">This module is necessarily an introduction; further suggestions of reading and of consequent activities will be provided. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">It may also be that students will wish to undertake a project in this area; several of the faculty involved will be pleased to discuss this with you.</p>

This module teaches Cranfield’s world-leading step-by-step process for developing such a marketing strategy and documenting it in a marketing plan. This process has been developed with hundreds of blue-chip companies worldwide over the last 30 years, informed by several Cranfield PhDs on the topic which have studied what works in practice. This planning process  is documented in the world’s leading textbook on the topic, McDonald &amp; Wilson’s Marketing Plans, which has sold over half a million copies. This book is used as the course text and students are strongly advised to acquire a copy from the library or through purchase to help bridge from the course to planning for real in their subsequent management roles.</span></p>

                                <p>Strategic Management is concerned with the direction and scope of the organisation.  This involves determining the purpose of the organisation, establishing objectives and formulating strategies to achieve the objectives. It predominantly explores how an organisation positions itself with regard to its changing environment, and in particular its competitors, in order to gain and sustain competitive advantage. This means that strategic management considers how an organisation’s internal resources and capabilities can be developed to meet the changing demands of customers, in such a way as to achieve the expectations and objectives of its stakeholders.  </p>

<p>This module reminds you of the major sustainability challenges facing organisations and explores how the most progressive ones are responding in-terms of leadership and strategy, mind-set, structure, supply chain collaborations, environmental and social impact and managing change.  It will engage you in gaining a better understanding of how organisational action can be best configured to promote a responsible and sustainable mission. In doing so, it will demand you to reflect on the long-standing debates concerning the political economy and ethical management practices.</p>

                                <p>Environmental sustainability is a main board issue.  General managers need to be able to navigate this agenda broadly, and their internal specialist officers, whether in regulatory affairs, sustainability, CSR, risk governance, procurement or finance may need to become intelligent customers for professional advice on environmental matters or experts in their own right.  This module is a postgraduate ‘primer’ for the aspiring general manager.  It seeks to equip you with:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The business case for reducing environmental impacts – termed sustainability, as viewed through various lenses including resource security, risk management, regulatory compliance, supply chain management.</li>
    <li>Case studies and critical reflections that contextualise good environmental governance from various business sectors.</li>
    <li>An overview of environmental analytics and decision tools (e.g. life cycle analysis, environmental risk assessment, environmental impact assessment, carbon and water foot-printing etc.) that are used increasingly to evidence good environmental performance.</li>
    <li>A summary of key technologies for the treatment of water, wastewater, waste, soil and air emissions, their general performance characteristics and principles of operation.</li>
<li>An update of current sustainability paradigms, including design for sustainability, the ‘circular economy’, smarter environmental regulation, sustainable manufacturing and their implications for business.</li></ul>

<p><strong>The Business Imperative for Environmental Sustainability</strong></p>
<p>We begin with a discussion on the business case for environmental sustainability.  What has been the history of engagement with the environmental sustainability agenda and why the recent acceleration of emphasis?  Connections to the circular economy, tomorrow’s company and the globalisation agenda will be made in considering the following topics:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Trade-off between the bottom line and reputation risk.</li>
    <li>Proactive environmental management versus the cost and risk associated with passive regulatory compliance.</li>
    <li>Evolving expectations of shareholders and stakeholders.</li>
    <li>Optimising long-term impacts of energy, carbon, and waste on business.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Case Studies</strong></p>
<p>Next we examine key issues from a resource perspective, i.e. energy, water, GHG emissions, land &amp; soil needs, plus resource loss through waste. Industry sectors and specific businesses with major impacts are introduced and these benefits in managing impacts for strategic competitive advantage explained.  Examples include the developments that specific sectors have followed are included.  Pinch points and key ‘shifts’ that prompted the change are also discussed.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Tools and Techniques for Environmental Decision-making</strong></p>
<p>Corporate commitments to the environment without defensible metrics are no longer credible.  Here we examine some of the principal tools used to secure regulatory approvals, examine whole-life impacts, measure carbon and water footprints, and quantify risk.  Practical in approach, we explore what works in real life, the decision power such tools can offer and the current state of the art.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Technology Selection and Appraisal</strong></p>
<p>Pollution prevention and control requires choices over a bewildering array of environmental technologies to minimise wastes, recover materials and energy and treat toxic residuals.  We will walk though some of the established and emerging technologies for pollution prevention, critique and appraise them and discuss the operational requirements.  The aim is to make you as future intelligent customers aware of the right questions to ask when faced with appraising technology recommendations.  A visit to a local materials recovery plant will reinforce the complex and heterogeneous nature of waste and resource management. In particular attention will be given to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The context, causes, definition and approaches to waste management.</li>
    <li>Technology types and principles.</li>
    <li>Selection methods and decision-making levels; strategic to operational.</li>
    <li>Principles of energy recover and carbon cycling.</li>
    <li>Innovation, trade-offs and sources of information.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Sustainable Design and Manufacturing</strong></p>
<p>How do these principles and practices work through in a manufacturing and production environment?  The concepts of design for sustainability and sustainable manufacturing will be considered through worked examples. For example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Discussing the impact and subsequent importance of considered design for the environment.</li>
    <li>Introduction to the historical context of design for sustainability.</li>
    <li>Examples of best practice in sustainable design approaches including dematerialisation, design for reuse and repair, design for disassembly and longevity.</li>
    <li>Facilitating the move from a linear to a circular and regenerative approach to design: whole system design, regenerative models for business and production.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><strong>Sustainable Operations</strong></p>
<p>Understanding what practices are used in manufacturing operations to reduce resource use and how these can be translated into tactics for eco-efficiency and beyond.  References will be made to improvement methodologies that capture process improvement sequence as well as supporting tools for analysis.</p>

                                <p>This module engages you in a ‘live’ sustainability issue within a client organisation. This organisation will be invited to meet you and given the opportunity to present a management issue focused on a corporate responsibility and sustainability matter at the start of the module.  This client’s challenge will inspire discussion and become the foundation for the problem solving activity you will engage.</p>
<p>You will work in learning teams over a 5 day period to generate a viable response (or potential solution) for the client organisation.  In this consulting like operation you will investigate the organisational context and sustainability challenge in depth and discuss potential avenues (and their implementation implications) for its resolution.  Your teams will subsequently produce a design specification for their proposed solution and present it to the client organisation at the end of the week long module.  The in-company assignment is a competitive exercise and a ‘winning’ team, proposing the best solution, will be chosen by the client organisation.</p>
<p>You will be free to explore the aspects of corporate responsibility and sustainability they feel are most appropriate for the organisation to succeed in its endeavours. </p>
<p>This module will allow you to gain a broader and better understanding of how organisational action can be best configured to promote responsible and sustainable business behaviours and strategies.</p>

Both business models overlap extensively with what is regarded as traditional entrepreneurship, but have distinctively different features: while being profit-or surplus-making, their aims typically embrace social outcomes and purposes, and their distribution or sharing of value created is frequently closely linked to these declared values.</p>
<p>Students will be introduced to the history and evolution of non-mainstream modes of entrepreneurship and will develop their understanding of how social entrepreneurs/social intrapreneurs and intrapreneurs create and operate enterprises/intrapreneurial activities in different environments.  They will see how such enterprises fit within the spectrum of profit and not for profit entities, and how these are regarded by policy-makers and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>Students will emerge with a clearer idea of whether they would like to make a career in this business environment or, indeed, aspire to found their own social enterprise or pursue a corporate intrapreneurial initiative.</p>

This module teaches Cranfield’s world-leading step-by-step process for developing such a marketing strategy and documenting it in a marketing plan. This process has been developed with hundreds of blue-chip companies worldwide over the last 30 years, informed by several Cranfield PhDs on the topic which have studied what works in practice. This planning process  is documented in the world’s leading textbook on the topic, McDonald &amp; Wilson’s Marketing Plans, which has sold over half a million copies. This book is used as the course text and students are strongly advised to acquire a copy from the library or through purchase to help bridge from the course to planning for real in their subsequent management roles.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">It is rarely an absence of planning that causes organisational difficulties; rather it is the failure of management in understanding and managing complex personal and interpersonal systems that can lead to significant problems.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Similarly an acute and critical understanding of these dynamic relationships can lead to profound and enduring success and benefit for the individual, the team, the organisation and wider society.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">In this module students will be introduced to various aspects of people and organisations.  This module combines models, theories and ideas from organisational behaviour, psychology, and sociology in order to provide students with a basic understanding in recognising, understanding and utilising what has been termed the ""human factor"" in organisations; including ways of conceptualising organisations and how people behave within them.  We shall consider the impact of the external environment; and address notions of organisational change.</p>

                                <p>In essence this module is concerned with managing the organisation’s key resource – the people who work for it. It aims to help participants understand how effective people management and human resource management can contribute to develop and sustain organisations. The focus of the module will be concerned with helping participants understand the relationship between people management and organisational performance, including the crucial role of line managers. The module aims to develop an insight into the complexities of managing people in a changing environment.</p>
<p>The module will provide an introduction to the main activities associated with resourcing, developing and day–to-day management of people in work organisations. It is not the intention of the module to develop human resource management specialist, but rather to provide a general introduction to the people management issues that concern all managers. Throughout, the sessions will be highly interactive in order to develop critical insight and core skills in the people management field.</p>
<p>The module will draw on key academic contributions in the broad field of people management, including current research being carried out by faculty in the School of Management. </p>

                                <p>Strategic Management is concerned with the direction and scope of the organisation.  This involves determining the purpose of the organisation, establishing objectives and formulating strategies to achieve the objectives. It predominantly explores how an organisation positions itself with regard to its changing environment, and in particular its competitors, in order to gain and sustain competitive advantage. This means that strategic management considers how an organisation’s internal resources and capabilities can be developed to meet the changing demands of customers, in such a way as to achieve the expectations and objectives of its stakeholders.  </p>

                                <p>Global sustainability challenges are shaping the way business operates in the 21st century. Businesses are under increasing pressure from multiple stakeholders (for e.g. shareholders, customers, employees, society) to manage their positive and negative impacts with clear responsibility and strategic intent.  Leading firms are choosing to respond to these challenges by generating sustainable value propositions to ultimately drive competitive advantage. For many this has meant re-engaging at the level of purpose and re-addressing their role in wider society and for human well-being.</p>
<p>This module outlines the major sustainability challenges and explores the capabilities organisations require to respond positively to them. It will engage you in gaining a better understanding of how corporate action can be best configured to promote responsible and sustainable business strategies. In doing so, it will demand management students (as future business managers and leaders) to reflect on the long-standing debate about whether or not ‘the business of business, is still business?</p>

Geographical information represents a key theme in environmental management and it has been estimated that some 80% of the data used for environmental, business and policy-oriented decision making is geographical in nature. Such spatial data requires a structured approach in their management if the maximum benefit is to be derived from their analysis and dissemination. This module provides you with a solid introduction to the issues concerning the management of spatial information and the tools to do so, with a predominant focus on open source software solutions.</p>

                                <p>Geographical information is now increasingly prevalent in our daily life, affecting personal leisure activities as much as the workplace. Geographical information represents a key theme in environmental management and, indeed, it has been estimated that some 80% of the data used for environmental, business and policy-oriented decision making is geographical in nature. This poses particular challenges to its efficient and timely dissemination to stakeholders and potential end users. Today, the Internet offers a pervasive medium for real-time delivery of geographical information and location-based web services, across a range of computing platforms. Such approaches offer extremely powerful means to reach out to a broad audience of users, particularly those who do not necessarily have the required skills to access or operate specialist GIS software packages. Web mapping offers a means to ‘democratise’ geospatial data – but with a wealth of technical approaches available to develop contemporary web data services and mapping solutions, there needs to be a sound understanding of these choices and approaches if the maximum benefit is to be derived from their analysis and dissemination online. This module provides a solid introduction to the issues concerning the management and dissemination of web mapping and spatial data on the Internet. </p>

It presents the fundamental principles of contemporary logistics and supply chain management within a business context.  This unit will explore the ways in which good practice in these fields can contribute to achieving sustainable competitive advantage. Overarching aspects of Supply chain sustainability are explored, such as corporate responsibility and ethics. Further the Global Supply Chain Game will enable students to understand through an interactive and competitive business game the principles of building an efficient global sourcing and supply chain under conditions of uncertainty so as to achieve high levels of profit and product availability.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span style=""font-weight: lighter;"">Global marketplaces are characterised by shortening product life cycles, increasing product variety, and highly variable demand that is difficult to forecast.  The module explores how the competitive landscape is constantly changing, and the role of logistics and supply chain management in meeting the challenges raised.  Research from Cranfield faculty is integrated with our own case studies, originating from a network of companies in a range of sectors to demonstrate particular concepts around agile and lean supply chains.</span></p>

                                <p>Managerial decisions in logistics and supply chain management are heavily based on quantitative analysis using models from the management science discipline. Data, models, and available software have dramatically changed the operations in manufacturing, services, and logistics sectors. The module aims to provide students with an introduction to the role and the relevance of analytical techniques in logistics and supply chain management.</p>
<p>From simple graphs to deterministic and stochastic optimisation models, it offers transferable skills to use associated techniques for the practice of these disciplines. Students will develop the ability to model and solve realistic decision problems in the context of logistics and supply chain management. This process will be facilitated by spreadsheet-based software packages where the students will have an opportunity to build their own spreadsheet models with emphasis on appropriate application of methods and interpretation of model outputs.</p>

                                <p>The Freight Transport module provides a sound foundation in road, rail, air and sea freight transport.  The focus is primarily from a user perspective in order to provide a logistics and supply chain management viewpoint.  However, in road freight, the module also covers more detailed fleet management and operational aspects, recognising that many organisations operate their own road transport fleets but also reflecting the importance of road freight as the primary inland freight mode in most geographies for national and urban freight traffic.</p>

                                <p>This is an introduction to the subject. However, it is our contention that projects are the building blocks of strategy. Also, the module provides a logical and simple process by which you may approach their own modules and objectives, and may well be a valuable source of confidence for taking on major elective projects later in the year.</p>
<p>Project Management Introduction<span> (PMI) demonstrates how management respects no boundaries (either in terms of functional silos – departments, etc. or theoretical disciplines). </span><span>PMI</span><span> provides additional opportunities to practice personal communication skills, and generally the module provides a basis for personal development and increased confidence and self-awareness.</span></p>

                                <p>The heart of any logistics and supply chain operation is its physical network.  The location of factories, distribution centres, suppliers, customers and so forth and the means by which they are linked, fundamentally affects the efficiency with which an organisation’s network operates. This module aims to introduce the concepts and techniques of network theory and analysis and use these to demonstrate how physical networks are designed, redesigned and optimised and how current supply chain trends and challenges are influencing this design. All aspects of the module are illustrated by the use of practical examples, ranging from manual calculations through to computerised network optimisation software.</p>

                                <p style=""text-align: left;"">Performance measurement and management (PMM) has been on the agenda of both academics and practitioners in both private and public sectors for several decades. However, despite the substantial resources invested in PMM by organisations, research shows that PMM-related initiatives, such as the implementation of scorecards or the adoption of PM procedures, can often fail to bring the intended benefits. Moreover, sometimes they turn out to be detrimental to the performance of the organisation!<span style=""font-weight: lighter;""> </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">If organisations are to realise value and become more sustainable in the longer term, it is crucial to understand <em>how</em> <em>exactly</em> performance measurement and management practices deliver improved performance. Even more, when several interconnected organisations form a part of a supply network, the measurement task is particularly complicated. Does performance measurement in supply networks deserve special treatment? Do the general principles of organisational performance management still apply? These are some of the questions the module will address.<span style=""font-weight: lighter; text-align: left;""> </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">This module will focus on the types and structures of performance measurement systems such as the Balanced Scorecard and the Performance Prism and on the design of appropriate strategy and success maps, performance targets, and indicators.</p>

In today’s interconnected world future supply chain professionals have to recognise potential risks of experiencing a supply chain disruption and be able to prepare for, react to and recover from the unforeseen supply chains, i.e. to develop resilience. This module explores the dimensions, approaches, decision-making and causalities of resilience. Insights from retrospective and real time case studies will provide the basis for understanding the vulnerability of today’s global supply chains. Moreover, they will enable you to experiment both with the perspectives of supply chain planners anticipating supply chain risks and improving the resilience of the supply chain design and supply chain continuity managers responsible for ensuring rapid recovery after a disruptive event.</span></p>

The “Ecosystem Service” approach provides a framework for society to address key environmental issues such as food production, greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity loss, and water use.  The “Circular Economy” approach refers to the development of “restorative” industrial systems that are grounded on the lessons of non-linear, feedback-rich ecosystems.  The third approach is to explore the nexus between renewable energy, food, and other ecosystem services using per capita energy and food consumption. This module introduces and critiques the three approaches and examines their application to resolve real-world problems and create commercial opportunities.</p>

                                <p>Environmental accounting is being used by institutions and businesses to guide decision making regarding competing projects and programmes. It involves financial appraisal, environmental valuation, and economic appraisal (or social cost-benefit analysis). This module explores the economic concepts and techniques that can be used for the valuation of non-market social and environmental services. You will also gain practical experience in extending a financial analysis to allow an economic appraisal.</p>

                                <p>Global sustainability challenges are shaping the way business operates in the 21st century. Businesses are under increasing pressure from multiple stakeholders (for e.g. shareholders, customers, employees, society) to manage their positive and negative impacts with clear responsibility and strategic intent.  Leading firms are choosing to respond to these challenges by generating sustainable value propositions to ultimately drive competitive advantage. For many this has meant re-engaging at the level of purpose and re-addressing their role in wider society and for human well-being.</p>
<p>This module outlines the major sustainability challenges and explores the capabilities organisations require to respond positively to them. It will engage you in gaining a better understanding of how corporate action can be best configured to promote responsible and sustainable business strategies. In doing so, it will demand management students (as future business managers and leaders) to reflect on the long-standing debate about whether or not ‘the business of business, is still business?</p>

                                <p>The purpose of this module is to provide you with a set of practical applications and tools for developing, managing and analysing ‘Big Data’, to better deliver food security. A secure, reliable and sustainable food production system will increasingly rely on advanced technologies, such as real-time field sensing, model data fusion and advanced forecasting. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It will need to operate effectively within new and changing environmental constraints, and so will need to consider and be represented within (eco)systems goods and services models, to ensure food security that is both economic and environmentally sustainable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> The proposed course will introduce and develop core skills in data acquisition, data and information management, using numerical and statistical modelling approaches that form the basis of information driven sustainable agriculture. It will incorporate ground, aerial and space borne sensing and sensor techniques for predictive mapping within the context of modelling agricultural ecosystems goods and services.</p>

                                <p>Water is an essential factor of production in agrifood systems; whether for growing crops, supporting livestock or food manufacture. Globally, 70% of freshwater withdrawals are used for agriculture, but increasing demand for food means that this figure is likely to increase dramatically in the future. At the same time climate change is affecting supply and other demands on water are increasing. Mismanagement of water for food production has led to social and environmental problems in many places. Water is therefore a significant global risk to sustainable food production. This module will consider the water requirements of crop and livestock systems; the evaluation of the water related impacts and risks in producing locations; and management and technological solutions to minimise water related impacts and risks in food supply chains.</p>

                                <p>Strategic foresight research refers to a range of methods that can be used to identify, analyse and communicate insights about the future. Standard methods include horizon scanning, trend research, and scenario planning. Outputs include emerging issues, trends, visions, scenarios, and wild cards. The methods employed and insights produced are used by both private and public sector organisations to inform a wide range of policy, risk, strategy and innovation processes. Foresight research is a truly inter-disciplinary ‘science’, covering and combining developments in society, technology, economy, ecology, politics, legislation and values.</p>
<p>Crucially, foresight research is as much about analysing the past and present, as it is about looking to the future. Once we understand how a system has developed and works today, we can explore how it may evolve and what it may look like in the future. Strategic foresight techniques consider a wide range of possible, plausible futures so that planning can be put in place to adapt to and mitigate against various conditions. It is designed to add resilience, adaptability and flexibility to organisations in an increasingly complex and fast changing world.</p>
<p>This module will explore how:</p>
<li>Horizon scanning can act as a method of gathering new insights that may point us towards affirming or discrediting existing trends and developments, as well as identifying new and emerging trends and developments that are on the margins of our current thinking, but will impact on the future.</li>
<p>Other foresight methodologies (e.g. scenario planning, visioning, back-casting) can be used to help us to use the trends identified from horizon scanning to identify how the future might develop</p>

<li>An overview of where different types of foresight research methods are best applied depending on the issue to be explored, the time available for research and the output required.</li>
<li>A practical training session in horizon scanning (what is does; why it’s used and how it’s done).</li>
<li>A practical training session on different scenario building methods (what are scenarios, what can they  be used for and how are they developed).</li>
<li>A group activity  to stress-test the resilience of organisational policy or strategy, using windtunnelling approaches [why is it important to stress-test the organisation’s policy / long-term strategy, what approaches are used, what are the likely gains (i.e. in the future)].</li>
<li>A group activity to develop a vision [i.e. describing a preferred future (the vision)], and using back-casting to assess the implications of the vision [i.e. setting out the steps to make it happen), and evaluating enablers and barriers to achieving desired outcomes.</li>

                                <p>Global sustainability challenges are shaping the way business operates in the 21st century. Businesses are under increasing pressure from multiple stakeholders (for e.g. shareholders, customers, employees, society) to manage their positive and negative impacts with clear responsibility and strategic intent.  Leading firms are choosing to respond to these challenges by generating sustainable value propositions to ultimately drive competitive advantage. For many this has meant re-engaging at the level of purpose and re-addressing their role in wider society and for human well-being.</p>
<p>This module outlines the major sustainability challenges and explores the capabilities organisations require to respond positively to them. It will engage you in gaining a better understanding of how corporate action can be best configured to promote responsible and sustainable business strategies. In doing so, it will demand management students (as future business managers and leaders) to reflect on the long-standing debate about whether or not ‘the business of business, is still business?</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">It is rarely an absence of planning that causes organisational difficulties; rather it is the failure of management in understanding and managing complex personal and interpersonal systems that can lead to significant problems.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Similarly an acute and critical understanding of these dynamic relationships can lead to profound and enduring success and benefit for the individual, the team, the organisation and wider society.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">In this module students will be introduced to various aspects of people and organisations.  This module combines models, theories and ideas from organisational behaviour, psychology, and sociology in order to provide students with a basic understanding in recognising, understanding and utilising what has been termed the ""human factor"" in organisations; including ways of conceptualising organisations and how people behave within them.  We shall consider the impact of the external environment; and address notions of organisational change.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">This module is necessarily an introduction; further suggestions of reading and of consequent activities will be provided. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">It may also be that students will wish to undertake a project in this area; several of the faculty involved will be pleased to discuss this with you.</p>

This module teaches Cranfield’s world-leading step-by-step process for developing such a marketing strategy and documenting it in a marketing plan. This process has been developed with hundreds of blue-chip companies worldwide over the last 30 years, informed by several Cranfield PhDs on the topic which have studied what works in practice. This planning process  is documented in the world’s leading textbook on the topic, McDonald &amp; Wilson’s Marketing Plans, which has sold over half a million copies. This book is used as the course text and students are strongly advised to acquire a copy from the library or through purchase to help bridge from the course to planning for real in their subsequent management roles.</span></p>

                                <p>Strategic Management is concerned with the direction and scope of the organisation.  This involves determining the purpose of the organisation, establishing objectives and formulating strategies to achieve the objectives. It predominantly explores how an organisation positions itself with regard to its changing environment, and in particular its competitors, in order to gain and sustain competitive advantage. This means that strategic management considers how an organisation’s internal resources and capabilities can be developed to meet the changing demands of customers, in such a way as to achieve the expectations and objectives of its stakeholders.  </p>

                                <p>In essence this module is concerned with managing the organisation’s key resource – the people who work for it. It aims to help participants understand how effective people management and human resource management can contribute to develop and sustain organisations. The focus of the module will be concerned with helping participants understand the relationship between people management and organisational performance, including the crucial role of line managers. The module aims to develop an insight into the complexities of managing people in a changing environment.</p>
<p>The module will provide an introduction to the main activities associated with resourcing, developing and day–to-day management of people in work organisations.

Throughout, the sessions will be highly interactive in order to develop critical insight and core skills in the people management field.</p>
<p>The module will draw on key academic contributions in the broad field of people management, including current research being carried out by faculty in the School of Management. </p>

                                <p>In many organisations, projects are the units of work by which the organisation operates, and value is delivered. In organisations where functional departments dominate the organisational design, strategic and change projects are run across these functions. Currently, there is a heightened emphasis on delivery within both government and industry with a widespread expectation that the approach of managing through projects will provide assurance in such delivery. It is an interesting challenge that this expectation is often not matched by performance. </p>
<p>This elective focusses on the following module aims:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Develop a robust baseline of knowledge and understanding of the fundamental principles of project management;</li>
    <li>Introduce key theories, principles, processes, tools and techniques underpinning project management;</li>
    <li>Raise critical awareness of common methods and other guidance for practical application;</li>
    <li>You to demonstrate your learning in planning for a simulated project.  </li>

Leaders who are able to understand their own cultural values, norms and preference, who are able to recognise and interact successfully with people from other cultures have an advantage in our globalised world. In short, cultural understanding, adaptability and intelligence are highly advantageous.</span></p>
<p><span>This module explores management and leadership issues arising from working with different cultures in a domestic or international context and enables students to more successfully manage a range of cross-cultural challenges. It does so using a blend of practical examples, research-based theories and experiential teaching methods.</span></p>

                                <p>Global sustainability challenges are shaping the way business operates in the 21st century. Businesses are under increasing pressure from multiple stakeholders (for e.g. shareholders, customers, employees, society) to manage their positive and negative impacts with clear responsibility and strategic intent.  Leading firms are choosing to respond to these challenges by generating sustainable value propositions to ultimately drive competitive advantage. For many this has meant re-engaging at the level of purpose and re-addressing their role in wider society and for human well-being.</p>
<p>This module outlines the major sustainability challenges and explores the capabilities organisations require to respond positively to them. It will engage you in gaining a better understanding of how corporate action can be best configured to promote responsible and sustainable business strategies. In doing so, it will demand management students (as future business managers and leaders) to reflect on the long-standing debate about whether or not ‘the business of business, is still business?</p>

This involves determining the purpose of the organisation, establishing objectives and formulating strategies to achieve the objectives. It predominantly explores how an organisation positions itself with regard to its changing environment and in particular its competitors, in order to gain and sustain competitive advantage. This means that strategic management considers how an organisation’s internal resources and capabilities can be developed to meet the changing demands of customers, in such a way as to achieve the expectations and objectives of its stakeholders.</span></p>

The module then explores corporate level strategy and the issue of strategy implementation and change. Throughout the module a range of tools and techniques for strategic analysis and choice will be introduced.</p>

                                <p>A good understanding of techniques of valuation of firms as well as the different securities issued by firms is vital for managers and financial analysts. This understanding has a bearing on both financing decisions (issue of equity or debt) and investment decisions (identifying securities for inclusion in a portfolio, acquisitions, buy-backs, divestitures etc.). In addition, building sound financial models is critical for understanding and communicating valuations. This course provides the framework for valuing equity and firms as well as financial modelling to aid decision making.</p>

<p>The following sessions are devoted to the detailed discussion of underlying theoretical models which explain the relationship between interest rates, inflation, and other macro-economic variables and the exchange rates. How forward rates are determined in the market and why covered interest rate arbitrage and carry trades occur and how they are used by investors to exploit disequilibrium in the foreign exchange rates. This is followed by the discussion of why and how multinational corporations invest in foreign markets. The key determinants of FDI with a particular emphasis on emerging markets are explored in detail. </p>

<p>This is followed by discussion of basics of currency derivatives and how they work. The remaining sessions are devoted to the discussion of different types of foreign exchange exposures and how they affect market value. How transaction and operating exposure are managed by both internal hedging techniques and derivatives are discussed in detail using case studies. </p>

<p>A detailed discussion of how interest rate risks arise and how it affects the multinational corporations is followed by how these risks are managed. Students learn about interest rate and currency swaps, how they are set up and how they are valued. The final sessions are used for discussion of international capital budgeting process, how it is done and how key risks need to be considered and managed.</p>

                                <p>This elective is concerned with firms that for a variety of reasons experience serious performance decline and begin to destroy value rather than create it. Such firms are generally described as financially distressed firms although the causes of their decline are not entirely financial. The course focuses on some of the most prominent types of corporate restructuring such as debt restructuring, equity restructuring, and corporate spin-offs.  The course will also focus on transactions significantly affecting the corporation’s assets, liabilities and/or equity claims and will stress the economic motives for undertaking them. Transactions will be examined from the perspective of the corporation (e.g., firm managers), from the perspective of capital markets (e.g., investors, stockholders, creditors) as well as from the perspective of the society.</p>

In addition, building sound financial models is critical for understanding and communicating valuations. This course provides the framework for valuing equity and firms as well as financial modelling to aid decision making.</p>

In Part III, students will examine using a seminal textbook on business ethics the role and limitations of ethics in financial markets, ethical decision-making frameworks, and evaluate real world cases of lapses in culture and impact upon society and the markets. The challenge of identifying and promoting ethical behaviour will be acknowledged. </span></p>

    <li style=""text-align: justify;""><span>Students will investigate criticisms of financial market policies and shortcomings of supervision and review the response by regulators, notably in the banking sector for greater capital, more conservative liquidity provisions, and improved risk governance. Key corporate governance theories will be identified. While regulation presents a legal means to mitigate misconduct by institutions and individuals operating in the financial markets, ethical decision-making and an effective risk culture can offer greater hope over time when conventional supervision and law fail to live up to their promise. Two ethical-decision making frameworks will be introduced in a case study format, one from Jennings (2013) and the other via Ferrell et al. (2011).</span></li>

Technical analysis has become much more than simply identifying trends from charts, it encompasses inter-market analysis, complex indicators, aspects of portfolio construction and multilevel risk control. It is estimated that well over half the managed money uses algorithmic trading.

                                <p>The landscape of international investing has been constantly evolving. The historical dominance of the developed countries has been declining whilst the relative importance of developing countries with their emerging economies has been on the rise. The high rates of economic growth and access to their large markets have attracted international investors to invest in emerging markets. However, despite these trends, there is not enough known or understood about the opportunities and challenges that international investors face while investing in emerging markets. The aim of this elective is to provide students with a good understanding of rewards and risks of investing in emerging markets.  The module aims to offer both academic research and practical guidance on investing in emerging markets. The module also aims to explain why policies and regulations matter and how to risks can be managed.</p>

                                <p>Over the past decade environmental regulators and the public have aimed to improve the quality of environmental management by basing choices on reliable data and assessment. However risk analysts often develop their competencies from their specific profession, for which the requirements can vary across industries, government bodies and geographical boarders. There is therefore little consensus on the competencies risk analysts require to be considered proficient. This module aims to provide you with an understanding of the theory and practice of effective management of all phases of environmental hazards. The module covers key topics including conceptual model development, probability, risk characterisation, and informatics. In doing so, this module will provide you with a means of improving the capability and capacity to perform European-wide risk assessments.</p>

                                <p>Natural landscapes and built environments can be engineered to optimise the goods and services delivered to society, including provision of natural resources and the regulation of water and carbon. Technologies that prevent and/or reverse land degradation can be devised and implemented to ensure sustainable use of finite land resources. Environmental engineers and land managers need sound understanding of the environmental properties that determine land capability for any given desired end use, as well as the interrelationships between soil, water, vegetation and built structures. This understanding is grounded in basic soil physics, hydrology, hydraulics, geotechnics and agronomy. With this background, appropriate interventions such as drainage, soil erosion control, slope stabilisation and irrigation can be designed and implemented to improve inherent land quality. The required skills set also informs the management of environmental projects involving land forming, reclamation, restoration and protection, which require selection, design, engineering and maintenance of appropriate structures.</p>

Understanding the intra and inter-field hydrological and hydraulic processes and factors affecting these operating on hillsides and in channels is essential to ensure the delivery of ecosystem goods and services, including the provision, regulation and protection of natural resources such as water, land and soil. The aim of this module is to improve understanding of the drivers of catchment hydrological processes with regard to water quantity and quality, and how these can be managed through engineering practices including drainage, irrigation and soil erosion control. </p>

While the most visible outcome of this module is a written business plan, we will cover a wide area of issues related to starting and growing new ventures. The module is intended to expose you to the main issues associated with the dynamic and uncertain environment of new ventures. During the module, you are therefore required to form teams around ideas for new ventures and to develop and present plans to launch their business idea.</p>

                                <p>Human population growth and increased resource use per capita is placing unsustainable demands on the global ecosystem. This module explores sustainability using three approaches. The “Ecosystem Service” approach provides a framework for society to address key environmental issues such as food production, greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity loss, and water use.  The “Circular Economy” approach refers to the development of “restorative” industrial systems that are grounded on the lessons of non-linear, feedback-rich ecosystems.  The third approach is to explore the nexus between renewable energy, food, and other ecosystem services using per capita energy and food consumption. This module introduces and critiques the three approaches and examines their application to resolve real-world problems and create commercial opportunities.</p>

                                <p>Global sustainability challenges are shaping the way business operates in the 21st century. Businesses are under increasing pressure from multiple stakeholders (for e.g. shareholders, customers, employees, society) to manage their positive and negative impacts with clear responsibility and strategic intent.  Leading firms are choosing to respond to these challenges by generating sustainable value propositions to ultimately drive competitive advantage. For many this has meant re-engaging at the level of purpose and re-addressing their role in wider society and for human well-being.</p>
<p>This module outlines the major sustainability challenges and explores the capabilities organisations require to respond positively to them. It will engage you in gaining a better understanding of how corporate action can be best configured to promote responsible and sustainable business strategies. In doing so, it will demand management students (as future business managers and leaders) to reflect on the long-standing debate about whether or not ‘the business of business, is still business?</p>

                                <p>Environmental accounting is being used by institutions and businesses to guide decision making regarding competing projects and programmes. It involves financial appraisal, environmental valuation, and economic appraisal (or social cost-benefit analysis). This module explores the economic concepts and techniques that can be used for the valuation of non-market social and environmental services. You will also gain practical experience in extending a financial analysis to allow an economic appraisal.</p>

                                <p>A critical application of environmental risk management is in the development and appraisal of policy in central government and business. Policies are developed to manage environmental risks and selection of policy options must be informed by risk based tools and techniques. Doing so demands a comprehension of the technical, organisational and human elements of governing environmental risks and developing environmental policy.</p>
<p>his module draws these themes together by introducing core concepts and then illustrating these concepts with case studies spanning business and government, and finally application via a group exercise.  Core lectures are supported by multiple case studies, a workshop and module assignment.</p>

                                <p>While technological change is seen as the root cause of many environmental problems, it is simultaneously viewed as the means of solving such problems. This module explores technological change as part of positive sum strategies put forward by ecological modernisers. Theories of technological change are reviewed such as evolutionary, path dependent and long wave, and used to formulate technology policy to achieve environmental net gain or transition to a low carbon economy. These are then set in practical contexts such as innovation in manufacturing, ecological restoration or low-carbon living.</p>

                                <p>Strategic foresight research refers to a range of methods that can be used to identify, analyse and communicate insights about the future. Standard methods include horizon scanning, trend research, and scenario planning. Outputs include emerging issues, trends, visions, scenarios, and wild cards. The methods employed and insights produced are used by both private and public sector organisations to inform a wide range of policy, risk, strategy and innovation processes. Foresight research is a truly inter-disciplinary ‘science’, covering and combining developments in society, technology, economy, ecology, politics, legislation and values.</p>
<p>Crucially, foresight research is as much about analysing the past and present, as it is about looking to the future. Once we understand how a system has developed and works today, we can explore how it may evolve and what it may look like in the future. Strategic foresight techniques consider a wide range of possible, plausible futures so that planning can be put in place to adapt to and mitigate against various conditions. It is designed to add resilience, adaptability and flexibility to organisations in an increasingly complex and fast changing world.</p>
<p>This module will explore how:</p>
<li>Horizon scanning can act as a method of gathering new insights that may point us towards affirming or discrediting existing trends and developments, as well as identifying new and emerging trends and developments that are on the margins of our current thinking, but will impact on the future.</li>
<p>Other foresight methodologies (e.g. scenario planning, visioning, back-casting) can be used to help us to use the trends identified from horizon scanning to identify how the future might develop</p>

<li>A practical training session in horizon scanning (what is does; why it’s used and how it’s done).</li>
<li>A practical training session on different scenario building methods (what are scenarios, what can they  be used for and how are they developed).</li>
<li>A group activity  to stress-test the resilience of organisational policy or strategy, using windtunnelling approaches [why is it important to stress-test the organisation’s policy / long-term strategy, what approaches are used, what are the likely gains (i.e. in the future)].</li>
<li>A group activity to develop a vision [i.e. describing a preferred future (the vision)], and using back-casting to assess the implications of the vision [i.e. setting out the steps to make it happen), and evaluating enablers and barriers to achieving desired outcomes.</li>

This module aims to answer the question ‘what is OOP’ and to provide the student with the understanding and skills necessary to write well designed and robust OO programs in C++. Students will learn how to write C++ code that solves problems in the field of computational engineering, particularly focusing on techniques for constructing and solving linear systems and differential equations. Hands-on programming sessions and assignment series of exercises form an essential part of the course. <br>
An introduction to the Python language is also provided.<br>

                                <p>Computer graphics is a key element in the effective presentation and manipulation of data in engineering software.  The aim of this module is to provide an in depth practical understanding of the mathematical and software principles behind 2D and 3D visualisation using the widely used OpenGL (desktop) and WebGL (web based) graphic libraries. Representative GUI based 2D and 3D OpenGL/WebGL applications using both Javascript/HTML5 and the Qt development environment are employed. The module will also cover some of the more advanced rendering techniques including lighting, texturing and other image mapping methods used to enhance visual interpretation of data. An introduction to the implementation and use of Virtual Reality in engineering completes the module. Hands-on exercises and an assignment supplement the learning process.</p>

This module aims to answer the question ‘what is OOP’ and to provide the student with the understanding and skills necessary to write well designed and robust OO programs in C++. Students will learn how to write C++ code that solves problems in the field of computational engineering, particularly focusing on techniques for constructing and solving linear systems and differential equations. Hands-on programming sessions and assignment series of exercises form an essential part of the course. <br>
An introduction to the Python language is also provided.<br>

                                In modern autonomous systems, it is essential to design an appropriate decision making algorithm and also path planning. Therefore, this module aims to deliver not only fundamental and critical understanding of classical and advanced decision making and path planning theories, but also evaluation of their nature, purposes, pros and cons, and characteristics. This should enable students and course delegates to critically select and design appropriate decision making and path planning algorithms for their specific autonomous systems.<br>

                                <p>The course is aimed at giving potential Finite Element USERS basic understanding of the inner workings of the method.  <br>
<br>
The objective is to introduce users to the terminology, basic numerical and mathematical aspects of the method. This should help students to avoid some of the more common and important user errors, many of which stem from a ""black box"" approach to this technique. Some basic guidelines are also given on how to approach the modelling of structures using the Finite Element Method.  </p>

<span>You will apply combined heat and mass transfer phenomena in complex transient systems, modelled by finite differences methods in MATLAB.</span><br>
<br>
<span>The transient heat transfer will include time and spatial variable conduction, convection, and radiation terms. The transient mass transfer will include time and spatial variable bulk and Knudsen diffusion. </span><br>
<br>
<span>You will model single particle systems covering combustion, catalytic systems, cracking, reforming, CO2 cpature and other gas-solid systems. Within this breadth of systems, you will determine effectiveness factors and investigate the important role of diffusion and gas-solid reactions in order to mitigate rate limiting steps in order to enhance chemical reactions.</span><br>
<br>
<span>Using their MATLAB codes, you will develop independent research analyses as part of their assessment to determine the impact of variable input parameters such as porosity, temperature, and gas composition. This will develop your numerical modelling specialisms and independent thought and research strengths. </span><br>
<br>
<span>You will learn new skills in applying finite differences modelling to uncertain and complex systems and how to set relevant boundary and initial conditions for these systems. You will be able to discretise partial differential equations into ordinary differential equations and programme them into MATLAB such they can be solved with multivariable input adapted functions based on ODE15s. </span><br>
<br>
<span>You will explore the limits and real-world accuracy of these modelling techniques, rate expression relationships, and conversion fitting models (shrinking core model, random pore model etc.). You will also learn of the latest research being undertaken to improve the real-world accuracy of these modelling approaches, and will see where these modelling techniques are used in chemical reactor design in industry, and finally how researchers are applying these techniques to gain a deeper understanding of reaction mechanisms.</span></p>

<span>You will apply combined heat and mass transfer phenomena in complex transient systems, modelled by finite differences methods in MATLAB.</span><br>
<br>
<span>The transient heat transfer will include time and spatial variable conduction, convection, and radiation terms. The transient mass transfer will include time and spatial variable bulk and Knudsen diffusion. </span><br>
<br>
<span>You will model single particle systems covering combustion, catalytic systems, cracking, reforming, CO2 cpature and other gas-solid systems. Within this breadth of systems, you will determine effectiveness factors and investigate the important role of diffusion and gas-solid reactions in order to mitigate rate limiting steps in order to enhance chemical reactions.</span><br>
<br>
<span>Using their MATLAB codes, you will develop independent research analyses as part of their assessment to determine the impact of variable input parameters such as porosity, temperature, and gas composition. This will develop your numerical modelling specialisms and independent thought and research strengths. </span><br>
<br>
<span>You will learn new skills in applying finite differences modelling to uncertain and complex systems and how to set relevant boundary and initial conditions for these systems. You will be able to discretise partial differential equations into ordinary differential equations and programme them into MATLAB such they can be solved with multivariable input adapted functions based on ODE15s. </span><br>
<br>
<span>You will explore the limits and real-world accuracy of these modelling techniques, rate expression relationships, and conversion fitting models (shrinking core model, random pore model etc.). You will also learn of the latest research being undertaken to improve the real-world accuracy of these modelling approaches, and will see where these modelling techniques are used in chemical reactor design in industry, and finally how researchers are applying these techniques to gain a deeper understanding of reaction mechanisms.</span></p>

                                <p>Object oriented programming (OOP) is the standard programming methodology used in nearly all fields of major software construction today, including engineering and science and C++ is one of the most heavily employed languages. This module aims to answer the question ‘what is OOP’ and to provide the student with the understanding and skills necessary to write well designed and robust OO programs in C++. Students will learn how to write C++ code that solves problems in the field of computational engineering, particularly focusing on techniques for constructing and solving linear systems and differential equations. Hands-on programming sessions and assignment series of exercises form an essential part of the course. <br>
An introduction to the Python language is also provided.<br>

                                Digital Image Processing allows us to process visual information in computer systems. By processing visual information we can develop automated visual interpretation and understanding – artificial vision, itself a large part of wider field of the Artificial Intelligence. In order to achieve this we must be able to extract high-level visual information such as edges and regions from images and additionally allow for the efficient storage of large amounts of visual data. Here we concentrate on mid-level visual interpretation and image compression.<br>

Representative GUI based 2D and 3D OpenGL/WebGL applications using both Javascript/HTML5 and the Qt development environment are employed. The module will also cover some of the more advanced rendering techniques including lighting, texturing and other image mapping methods used to enhance visual interpretation of data. An introduction to the implementation and use of Virtual Reality in engineering completes the module. Hands-on exercises and an assignment supplement the learning process.</p>
