                                    <p><strong>Study hours</strong></p>
<p>This part-time course has a strong emphasis on self-guided study. A 10 credit module, for example, involves two hours of timetabled study per week for 15 weeks, backed up by significant independent study focussed on virtual  learning resources.</p>                                        <p><strong>Teaching methods</strong></p>
<p>Advanced Healthcare Practice offers a blended learning approach with staff always looking for new and engaging ways to develop competencies around healthcare roles. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>You will learn via key note lectures, case scenarios, workshops, discussions and clinical skills lab simulations. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>One innovative aspect of the programme is the integration of service users as part of clinical examination modules. Patient models have proved invaluable in terms of student feedback and improving the realism of scenarios.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>LJMU's virtual learning environment further enhances the learning experience and the use of wikis and group blog videos have received very positive feedback. All course lectures and materials are available online.</p>                        </div>

<p><strong>New Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) Standards</strong> </p>
<p>The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) is the professional body that evaluates and monitors all Nursing and Midwifery courses in the UK. Only education and training providers accredited by the NMC can deliver courses that lead to Qualified Nurse or Midwife status and registration with the NMC. </p>
<p>In 2018, the NMC released plans to update the standards for pre-registration nursing and midwifery programmes, starting after 28th January 2019. The new standards set out the entry requirements, length of programme, methods of assessment and the level of award. </p>
<p>To ensure that our programmes are at the forefront of nursing and midwifery education and meet the new standards, we've worked closely with our practice partners updating our course content and student assessment methods. This means you'll benefit from the most up to date, practice-informed learning.</p>
<p>In 2019, the NMC celebrated its 100th birthday. In this short film, produced to celebrate the milestone, qualified nurses share their expereinces of working in the profession.<br></p>

This represents a third of the required hours. You will complete the remaining hours during the two years of your MSc Nursing programme.</p><p>This means that you will have seven weeks of holiday a year, and may have to attend sessions outside the normal university hours of 9am to 5pm.</p>                                        <p><strong>Teaching methods</strong></p>

                                <h4>An insight into teaching on your course</h4>
                                    <p><strong>Study hours</strong></p>
<p>​The course runs part-time over two years. You will need: the support of your seconding employer to enable you to attend taught sessions one day a week and two days of supervised practice with the support of an appropriately qualified mentor.</p>
<div></div>                                        <p><strong>Teaching methods</strong></p>
<p>The programme follows a blended learning approach. This combines traditional teaching methods with opportunities for face-to-face sessions and access to online learning facilities. This is consolidated with classroom-based discussion and critical reflection on case studies led by experienced clinicians. You may choose to attend or actively participate in several sessions on your computer at home or work, in real time, or via catch up by accessing web-based recordings at a time which is convenient to you. </p>
<p>In year one you will complete clinically focussed modules, reflect on your practice and professional development and achieve the competencies required of an Advanced Paediatric and Neonatal Practitioner.</p>
<p>In year two you will advance your research skills and knowledge base to synthesise your learning and will complete a dissertation based on a research project you have developed and implemented. This will add to the knowledge base informing your professional practice.</p>                        </div>

<p>To complete the course you will need to be employed in a setting which will enable you to achieve the competencies associated with your chosen pathway. You will be supported via a tripartite agreement between yourself, your employer and LJMU. Practice-based mentors will be identified and will play a role in signing off each competency. This could include registered practitioners such as nurses, advanced paediatric practitioners and doctors. The development of a portfolio and competency record will complement and strategically support the ongoing process of practice learning. There are mandatory clinical practice hours associated with modules undertaken in year one.</p>                        </div>

  </p><p>During level 4, students gain basic knowledge and theory of the architectural technology discipline.  They gain an introduction to architectural technology in practice, with an emphasis on developing initial skills in the production of architectural drawings, via traditional manual draughting techniques and via computer aided design.  Students will study key themes in construction technology, environmental science and materials, and architectural design and specification.  Students will participate in a collaborative interdisciplinary project, and will become skilled in academic and digital literacy.</p>
  <p>During level 5, students develop understanding of the regulatory requirements for construction projects and produce architectural drawings for a building refurbishment project. They are introduced to the notion of the architectural technologist as an entrepreneur in property development and will learn about procurement and contracts. Students' progress and enhance their practical IT skills through project work, and involvement in a collaborative interdisciplinary project with a focus on building information modelling (BIM).  Students are also introduced to research methods skills as preparation for their final year research project.

This is achieved by a major comprehensive design project for a complex building, for example a school. The project culminates in an end of year presentation, critical review and end-of-year show with students presenting their work to industry experts. During the final year students undertake research as part of a student-led investigation into a specific aspect, and students will learn about professional practice, and the role of the professional body.</p>

                    <p>The learning and teaching environment is progressively informed by research in pedagogy in the creative field. While teaching the curriculum, the programme also develops less tangible skills in students, such as communication, presentation and self-motivation. A key ambition is to create independent thinkers, adept at resolving problems with creativity and originality.</p>

If you need advice about how you will pay your tuition fees, please email LJMU’s <a href=""mailto:studentadvice@ljmu.ac.uk"" target=""_blank"">Student Funding Team</a> as soon as possible.</p>
<p>To qualify for student funding for your MArch you need to have studied the BA (Hons) Architecture or RIBA Part 1 (at LJMU or elsewhere in the UK) and normally go on to study the RIBA Part 2 with no more than two years between the two courses. Students that take longer than this between Part 1 and Part 2 should seek advice from the LJMU <a href=""mailto:studentadvice@ljmu.ac.uk"" target=""_blank"">Student Funding Team</a> before starting the MArch as Student Finance will consider applications from those with longer gaps on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>If you are planning to commence an MArch course without first completing the BA (Hons) Architecture (RIBA Part 1), you may not be eligible for full funding for the MArch so should seek advice from the LJMU <a href=""mailto:studentadvice@ljmu.ac.uk"" target=""_blank"">Student Funding Team</a> before you commence your studies.</p>

<p style=""font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal;"">Art and science are often seen as two different entities with very separate ideas of what constitutes research. The MA Art in Science programme at Liverpool School of Art and Design aims to bring together artists and scientists to explore collaborative approaches in art and science. <br>
<br>
Increasingly, collaborations between artists and scientists are a feature of our cultural landscape. Traditionally this relationship has been perceived as art in the service of science, whereby artists use their skills to visually interpret or communicate complex scientific ideas, objects or forms. However, a hybrid form of research has emerged over the last 30 years where artists and scientists are interested in the creative possibilities and speculative futures of the intersection of these two cultures.<br>
<br>
This programme provides an opportunity for collaborations across the visual arts and the world of scientific enquiry, and encourages transdisciplinary creativity based on the skills that you bring with you to the programme and those you develop during your research experience. </p>

                                    <p><strong>Study hours</strong></p>
<p>Classroom contact is approximately 13 hours per week in Semester 1, and 11 hours per week in Semester 2. Self-study would bring the total study time to 60 hours per week.</p>                                        <p><strong>Teaching methods</strong></p>
<p>Teaching within modules normally involves delivering lectures to students in order to deliver core knowledge and underpinning theory which is reinforced by the use of tutorials and practice sessions. During the practice sessions a student-centered approach is normally taken, aimed at encouraging students to “learn by doing”.</p>                                        <p><strong>Applied learning</strong></p>
<p>Learning is heavily focused on applied learning related to audio restoration/forensics. The assessment philosophy is “learn by doing”.<br></p>                        </div>

                                    <p><strong>Study hours</strong></p>
<p>As a nursing student, you are required to complete 4,600 hours to meet the NMC requirements; 50% of this is theory and 50% is clinical practice. </p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.015em;"">Your Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) accounts for 770 hours of theory and 770 practice hours. This represents a third of the required hours. You will complete the remaining hours during the two years of your MSc Nursing programme.</span><br></p><p>As soon as you enrol at LJMU, you will be assigned your own personal tutor, and will meet with them regularly throughout each year. Your personal tutor will give you feedback on how well you are progressing with your studies and encourage you to plan for your educational and career development. </p>                                        <p><strong>Teaching methods</strong></p>
<p>You will be taught by clinically credible staff and those who are research active, along with experienced nurses and health care professionals, who will help you to develop both clinically and intellectually during the programme.</p><p>As soon as you enrol at LJMU, you will be assigned your own personal tutor, and will meet with them regularly throughout each year. Your personal tutor will give you feedback on how well you are progressing with your studies and encourage you to plan for your educational and career development.</p><p>You will complete a lot of your learning in our newly refurbished and extended Faculty of Health flagship building, Tithebarn Building. Tithebarn is home to our hospital-standard clinical practice suites, modern seminar rooms, lecture theatres and skills labs. </p><p>You may also have lectures in Marybone, which is just across the street from Tithebarn.</p><p>Blocks of academic study can be up to six weeks depending on what point in the programme you are at. </p><p>You'll participate in seminars, tutorials and lectures, undertaking both group work and individual assignments.</p>                                        <p><strong>Applied learning</strong></p>
<p>Clinical practice is a vital element of this degree and accounts for half of your study time at LJMU.<br><br>During your clinical practice placements, you will work 30 hours a week and will have a weekly study day of 7.5 hours.<br><br>During your clinical placements you will work alongside experienced nurses and registered healthcare professionals and be supervised by practice assessors and supervisors, as well as having the support of academic link lecturers. Additional support is always available within the Faculty or from student support workers if you need it. All new students coming in to the faculty will have a student mentor allocated to them. Student Mentors are second and third year students who have been selected and trained to mentor new students in all aspects of university life. The student mentor service offers an exciting opportunity for personal and professional development.</p>                        </div>

</p><p>Children's nurses provide essential physical, emotional, and psychological care to children, young people and their families. They play a crucial role in helping to improve and extend the health and life choices for children and young people via education, health promotion, support, advice or advocacy and sometimes protection.</p><img src=""https://prd-cm.ljmu.ac.uk/sitecore/shell/~/media/images/ljmu/postgraduate-course-images/course-images/ehc/nursing/nursingclinicalleadership.jpg?h=310&amp;la=en&amp;w=550"" alt=""Image of two people looking at computer monitor"" width=""550"" height=""310"" sc-part-of=""field"" class=""scEnabledChrome"" style=""font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; font-size: 20px; font-family: HelveticaNeueLTStd-Roman, Arial, sans-serif; letter-spacing: -0.24px; height: 310px; width: 550px;""><br><br>
<p>Children's nurses need to understand how a healthy child develops towards adulthood and how to minimise the impact of illness or hospital admission on the child. Excellent communication and observation skills are crucial as children are less able to communicate their symptoms than adults and it is vital that their development does not suffer additionally due to the stress of being ill or in hospital.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.015em;"">Child Nursing is not all about the child, as you also need to consider the care and support needed by the wider-family, including parents or those who look after the child at home. A child nurse ensures that the child (and their family or carers) are at the centre of all care decisions. Child nurses appreciate the diversity of health needs and will develop the required professional skills to support the empowerment of children and young people, families, carers, groups and communities.</span></p>

<p><strong>What our students say:</strong></p>
<p><em>""I came to look around John Moores after finding out it was one of the best nursing schools in the country. As soon as I arrived in Liverpool I had a feeling that this was where I'd want to be. There was just a vibe every time I visited which I really enjoyed and after speaking to students and staff I knew that I would receive so much support when I came here, which has proven to be true. The University is in an ideal location to get around and has fantastic links with placement areas to provide students with the best opportunities possible - this is especially true with Alder Hey.""</em></p>
<p>- Harvey Box, BSc (Hons) Child Nursing, 2nd year student</p>
<p><em>“Child nursing has allowed me to have the honour of looking after not only the children but their families at their most vulnerable. It has enabled me to be a smiling face that could brighten up a day in a difficult time.”</em></p>

<p><strong>New Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) Standards </strong></p>
<p>The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) is the professional body that evaluates and monitors all Nursing and Midwifery courses in the UK. Only education and training providers accredited by the NMC can deliver courses that lead to Qualified Nurse or Midwife status and registration with the NMC. </p>
<p>In 2018, the NMC released plans to update the standards for pre-registration nursing and midwifery programmes, starting after 28th January 2019. The new standards set out the entry requirements, length of programme, methods of assessment and the level of award. </p>
<p>To ensure that our programmes are at the forefront of nursing and midwifery education and meet the new standards, we've worked closely with our practice partners updating our course content and student assessment methods. This means you'll benefit from the most up to date, practice-informed learning. The course is currently subject to validation.</p>
<p><strong>Additional course costs</strong></p>
<p>Travel costs to placements and parking if using a car whilst on placement. However, you may be able to claim reimbursement of travel costs through The Learner Support Fund provided by the NHS Business Services Authority (NHSBSA).</p>
<p>Students who would like to buy extra uniform items, further to their standard uniform which is included in the course fees, have the option to do so. International experience may incur costs.</p>

                    <h4>LJMU's MA in Cities, Culture and Creativity provides a broad intellectual and academic understanding of urban development and cultural distinctiveness.</h4>
                    <ul>
    <li>Study in Liverpool, one of the leading arts and cultural centres outside of London (European Capital of Culture in 2008, UNESCO World Heritage Site)</li>
    <li>Develop a broad-based understanding of how key institutions, social groupings, and different representations of cities mediate urban development and cultural distinctiveness</li>
    <li>Follow a curriculum that plays a key role in developing your approaches to studying and knowledge application in the fields of creativity and culture in urban environments</li>
    <li>Enjoy excellent pastoral and academic support for placement opportunities</li>
    <li>The course has established itself a strong track record and reputation of moving its MA graduates on to PhD research</li>
</ul>
<p>This exciting new cross-disciplinary MA enables you to study contemporary UK and international cities from socio-economic, cultural, theoretical and practical perspectives.</p>
<p>Based in Liverpool - the scene of many innovative cultural programmes and urban regeneration initiatives, this programme focuses on the relationships between cities, culture and creativity. It features an innovative, multidisciplinary curriculum taught by expert academics.</p>
<p>You will gain an understanding of key urban theories, trends, policies and dynamics by drawing on a range of contemporary local and global case studies to illustrate debates and policy responses. You will reflect on how urban images and identities are constructed and reconstructed, by whom and for what purpose, focusing on concepts such as city marketing, place identity, place brand and branding.

                    <p>urban environment. Another aim of the programme is to develop graduates who have essential skills in research design, project management and relevant major qualitative research methods.</p>
<p>To examine how cultural policy fits with broader strategies for re-imagining and regenerating cities, you will use key skills to research and critically engage with the theories, principles, debates and intellectual paradigms that underpin the study of cities, culture and creativity. You will be expected to critically reflect on and communicate your research findings, knowledge and understanding throughout the degree.</p>
<p>Partners on this programme include the European Institute for Urban Affairs (EIUA), the Institute of Cultural Capital (ICC), the Liverpool Business School and the School of Humanities and Social Science.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Study hours</strong></p>
<p>A significant portion of learning activities will take place in your workplace as you apply your acquired knowledge and skills to the care of your patients. Students are expected to undertake approximately 8-10 hours per week of private study (which includes preparation for webinars and workshops, as well as completing assignments).</p>
<p><strong>Study days and webinars</strong><br>
<br>
Due to the impact of Covid-19, all live (synchronous) teaching activities will be delivered online by experienced and specialist practising pharmacists. When social distancing restrictions are eased, university-based teaching sessions will resume. Webinars are held either during week day lunch times (typically 1.00pm to 2.00pm) or during week day evenings (typically 8:00pm to 9:00pm). Dates will be provided following registration on the programme. Recordings of all sessions will be made available for those unable to attend.<br>
<br>
The provisional dates for the introductory webinar and online workshops for students starting the first year of the programme in March 2021 are:</p>
<p><strong>Introductory webinar</strong><br>

</ul>                                        <p><strong>Teaching methods</strong></p>
<p>The programme’s blended learning approach features a range of online directed study activities (including recommended reading, short recorded lectures and online quizzes), webinars, face-to-face study days (in the form of seminars and workshops) and workplace-based learning. In order to develop an ethos of adult learning, didactic teaching methods are minimised and completing the pre-requisites before attending webinars and study days will enable you to get the most benefit.</p>                        </div>

                                <h4>How learning is monitored on your programme</h4>
                                <p></p><p>To cater for the wide-ranging content of our courses and the varied learning preferences of our students, we offer a range of assessment methods on each programme. Assessment techniques vary from module to module to reflect relevant assessment approaches and the key learning points of each topic.</p>
<p>At the heart of the course is the requirement to maintain a professional practice portfolio, detailing clinical practice and personal development. Each module will involve formative and/or summative assessments, which help to contribute to this portfolio or draw on its content.</p>
<p>Assesment methods for this course include: written exams, oral and written case reports and written reports of activities such as practice evaluation exercises. Some modules also have competency requirements (pass/fail assessments). These components are based around demonstrating competence through Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs) and the professional practice portfolio.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>For the Master of Science Research Project Module you must submit a research project report.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>All assessments are moderated by an external examiner. If your overall performance is of a very good standard you will be awarded a Merit and where performance is of an exceptional standard, a Distinction will be awarded.</p>                        </div>

                                <h4>Securing your place at LJMU</h4>
                                    <p>You will apply for the majority of postgraduate courses using our <a href=""https://uaf.ljmu.ac.uk/"" target=""_blank"">online application form</a>. You should complete the form thoroughly and provide a detailed personal statement which reflects your suitability and aptitude for the programme.</p>
<p>Where an applicant has previously completed an independent prescribing qualification, it may be possible to recognise this prior learning within the programme structure and credit may be granted for the relevant modules that make up the prescribing award in the present programme. This is subject to approval by LJMU at the admissions stage.</p>
<p>LJMU will also consider students who have obtained an appropriate Postgraduate Diploma in Clinical Pharmacy from LJMU or another institution for direct entry to the MSc research project. This allows students to 'top up' an existing PgDip to a full MSc by completion of a research project. Students applying for this route do not need to be employed in a role in England, but must be in a position that would allow them to complete a relevant research project. Individuals interested in this route should contact the course leader by emailing: PBS-Office@ljmu.ac.uk to discuss their circumstances prior to submitting an application.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Study hours</strong></p>
<p>Students will have approximately two hours per module per week of taught material and/or seminar work. This may be supplemented by reflective tutorials during the semester. Private study will cover both time spent studying (e.g. in the library), collecting data in the laboratory and completing directed tasks and coursework. Taught sessions will provide an orientation to the topic and opportunity for classroom discussion and debate. You will also be expected to read widely using primary sources of reference material.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Teaching is on Mondays and Fridays in semester 1 and Tuesdays and Thursdays in semester 2. Semester 3 is for your clinical placement – times and hours will vary depending on the placement provider.</p>                                        <p><strong>Teaching methods</strong></p>
<p>Our teaching is delivered primarily through lectures, laboratory practicals and student-centred learning techniques, such as problem-based learning.</p>                        </div>

<p>In place of a traditional research project, you will have the opportunity to gain essential experience through a 140 hour clinical placement, based in a hospital clinical exercise physiology department or related department in the NHS or private healthcare sector. This extensive placement affords you the unique opportunity to apply the skills and knowledge gained during the Masters in a ‘real-world’ setting, and places you in a highly employable position.</p>                        </div>

                        Climate Change is a pressing and challenging issue facing society. Rising temperatures and sea levels, near global retreat of glaciers, alterations to precipitation patterns and frequent extreme weather events, climate induced changes in biogeographical patterns and loss of biodiversity pose severe threats to contemporary and future societies. The introduction of this new BSc in Climate Change will allow students to investigate the issue using interdisciplinary skills.

                    <h4>LJMU's Creative Technology MA is a practice-led programme that sets out to develop your technique and insight within the expanding creative media sector</h4>
                    <ul>
    <li>Develop advanced Storytelling, through a variety of contemporary media</li>
    <li>Explore social, interactive and immersive platforms in a variety of contexts from the street to the arena</li>
    <li>Become an inquisitive media practitioner, with a sophisticated understanding of how to exploit emerging technologies and realities</li>
    <li>Study in the £38 million Redmonds Building and enjoy full access to Liverpool Screen School's state-of-the-art facilities</li>
</ul>
<p>This MA offers you an opportunity to embark on a period of enquiry that operates at the forefront of developments in storytelling within the creative media and digital technology sectors. Whether your career in this sphere leads you to sell or tell, there are a myriad of converged, interactive, social, locative and immersive platforms that should be explored in the development of compelling ‘storyworlds’.</p>
<p>Novel media technologies continue to emerge, affording genuine opportunities for individuals to profitably exploit these in the pursuit of immersive narrative artefacts. Beyond the need to understand moving image, which pervades all our devices, we should exploit all media forms; new digital realities demand that we re-examine the visual, the locative, the social, the virtual, mixed and the merged.</p>

<p>Our aim is to develop inquisitive media practitioners with a sophisticated understanding of what creative technology might afford. To create advanced and autonomous learners, able to assess new technologies for their potential in the development of innovative media outcomes and then in response, to produce finished artefacts as an individual, or to assemble teams with the necessary skill-set to do so.</p>

                                            <h2>Modules</h2>
                                            <h4></h4>
<h3>Discover the building blocks of your programme</h3>
<p>Your programme is made up of a number of core modules which are part of the course framework. Some programmes also have optional modules that can be selected to enhance your learning in certain areas and many feature a dissertation, extended report or research project to demonstrate your advanced learning.</p>
<p><strong>Human Intelligence</strong></p>
<p>Human intelligence, or HUMINT as it is more commonly referred to, is, perhaps, the first covert collection discipline, an activity deployed by States and organisations for thousands of years. The module examines the HUMINT collection discipline by introducing the range of both overt and covert techniques. It will critically evaluate its important contribution to identifying and mitigating threats while also considering the associated ethical challenges that come with HUMINT use. You will critically examine the use of HUMINT in different social and operational contexts including the use of juveniles as informants, the role of informants who participate in crime and the use of legal representatives as informants. The module, recognising that HUMINT is not simply the domain of the State, also examines its increasing use in the private sector and non-government organisations. While focusing on the covert aspect on HUMINT, the module also equip you with an in-depth knowledge of community HUMINT and its application and integration into covert operational settings.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Forensic Elicitation of Intelligence</strong></p>
<p>The era of the ‘War on Terror’ highlighted the central role played by intelligence agencies, law enforcement and the military in securing the necessary critical intelligence to identify and mitigate threat. It was also an era where some of the accompanying policies and practices adopted to elicit intelligence were subject to close public and governmental scrutiny. Increasing pressure to secure high quality and timely intelligence led to accusations of questionable ethical elicitation techniques. This module aims to introduce the array of academic research associated with the elicitation of intelligence. It explores those techniques that appear to be both effective and ethical in securing information to better understand and then mitigate threat and harm. The module will examine various interview models and techniques, which when correctly applied against witnesses, victims, refugees, prisoners or other detainees can effectively and ethically contribute to satisfying intelligence reporting requirements and progress investigations.</p>
<p><strong>Covert Techniques: Legislation and Operational Capability</strong></p>
<p>This module examines the array of covert techniques routinely deployed against criminals, aggressive State and non-state actors. It critically evaluates the governing legislation and procedures relating to the deployment of covert techniques and will critically assess the debate on what is the appropriate balance between privacy and security. Youwill assess covert methods and technical equipment currently available to organisations and the relevant law, procedures and guidance governing their use in both reactive and proactive investigations. The module will critically evaluate the benefits and risks of managing the product from covert activities together with the authorisation processes, governance, and accountability in place.  It will also cover an often-overlooked area of study; the role of tasking and coordination models and senior leaders in covert operations.</p>
<p><strong>Research Method</strong></p>
<p>The generation of high-quality academic research is critical for the development of effective covert and intelligence practice. This module provides an introduction to quantitative and qualitative research methods, and the types of skills necessary for the planning, data gathering and writing a research proposal. It includes research design, methods of data collection and approaches to managing and analysing data. The module provides a basic understanding of the underlying principles of quantitative and qualitative research and the links between the two. It will help you to choose  the most appropriate research method to address a particular research question.  The module will be geared towards you completing the dissertation or an independent and original research paper, which may shape and influence future practice.</p>
<p><strong>Covert investigation and Specialist Intelligence Dissertation</strong></p>
<p>The vocational nature of the postgraduate programme is further enhanced by the dissertation, which is particularly useful for working professionals who want to focus their efforts on a topic that has particular relevance either to their own work environment or one in which they may want to further develop their career. The dissertation enables you to investigate in-depth a topic within the field of Covert Investigation and Specialist Intelligence studies. You can select your own research area (subject to Programme Leader authorisation). The dissertation will include independent and original empirical research into policy and practice. It is expected that pertinent knowledge and skill gained in other course modules will be reflected in the dissertation. The dissertation allows you to undertake an independent and sustained piece of research into a substantive topic of your own choosing. It must include appropriate extended piece of empirical or theoretical research on a topic in the Covert Investigation and Specialist Intelligence studies field.</p>
<p><strong>Optional modules</strong></p>
<p><strong>Case Studies in Intelligence Success and Failure</strong></p>
<p>A disastrous military failure leading to a costly retreat, a successful surprise attack by terrorists with catastrophic consequences to a civilian population, or the death of a vulnerable person even after multiple indications of threat had been previously received by law enforcement. All these tragic circumstances can lead to accusations of State intelligence failure. However, what is meant by intelligence failure? Can it be predicted? Can it be prevented? In contrast, what makes for an intelligence success and can this success be replicated?  This module examines the concept of intelligence failure using real-world case studies, exploring the theoretical approaches to explain failure, and then, apply these against cases drawn from the military, intelligence agencies, law enforcement and multi-agencies working. This module offers a long-term view of the history of intelligence and then drills down to specific case studies, issues, and areas whose lessons are vital to understanding modern intelligence concepts and practice. By doing so, it enhances your critical thinking regarding the challenges that arise through gathering, evaluating, securing and using intelligence.  </p>                                </div>
                            </div>,<div class=""l-col-6 l-padinfull"" data-mh=""course-overview"">
                                <div class=""m-wysiwyg m-wysiwyg-white"">
<img src=""/~/media/images/ljmu/postgraduate-course-images/course-images/apss/policing/pc-digital-display-550px.jpg?h=367&amp;w=550&amp;la=en"" alt=""Image of students in classroom""><p><strong>Operational Ethics</strong></p>
<p>Intelligence professionals are employees of Governments and/or Business who operate in an area that some would consider unethical. Ethics play out for all ranks and grades in organisations that utilise covert methodology or collect intelligence. The norms that appears settled in the 1980s are now under scrutiny, with intelligence ethics now acting as a point of reference in public inquiries, both within the UK and further afield. Scandals involving intelligence agencies and law enforcement have led to growing demands for transparency and increased accountability. However, deception, secrecy and morally troubling compromises are often operationally necessary to mitigate risk and save lives. This module will focus on the ethical challenges arising from covert and specialist intelligence based operational practice and critically evaluate the dilemmas that may arise when someone is asked to perform a task that potentially interferes with the rights of others. Using case studies, this module examines how future operatives can best foster an ethical climate within their organisations and within the senior leadership team.</p>
<p><strong>Intelligence Analysis</strong></p>
<p>The module considers what intelligence and analysis means in an operational context. It explores its overall role and its application to security related issues of law enforcement, governmental agencies, international organisations, and the private sector. It examines issues pertaining to the use of proactive intelligence and analysis and does so by  using ‘real-world’ case-studies  which enables you to delve deeper into the nuanced variables that can both challenge analysts and also, enhance modern analytical practice.</p>
<p><strong>Investigative Interviewing</strong></p>
<p>Effective interviewing is central to the success of both overt and covert investigation and accordingly, the highest standards of practice need to be upheld. It can identify both the guilt and innocence of people. It can support the prosecution case and, if effective, can increase public confidence. In this context, interviewees can include victims, witnesses, prisoners and suspects. Agencies, both private and State need to develop and maintain interview skills of their employees. Effective interviewing can assist with directing the interview. It can ensure they are undertaken ethically and are consistent with the rule of law. This module critically explores the intersection of psychology and policing and it does so by examining current practices, techniques and applications of police interviewing. You will be exposed to comparative international techniques in interviewing, interpretation of verbal and physical behaviour and the causes of denial, deception and defensiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure</strong></p>
<p>Securing a successful prosecution while still being able to protect covert methodology and sensitive sources is critical for the long-term success of law enforcement and intelligence agencies. This module will critically examine the principles of disclosure, taking the student through a structured, methodical process, discussing common law principles that apply, the statutory law as set out in the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 and the supporting codes of practice. It will also explore the role and responsibilities of investigators, disclosure officers and the Senior Investigating Officer, the disclosure test contained within the legislation and the requirements placed on the prosecution and the defence. You will critically evaluate the common law rules of disclosure in the early stages of the investigation and prosecution case. There will be a focus on managing disclosure in complex cases, the scheduling and dealing with sensitive material, the application of Public Interest Immunity (PII) and considerations around third party material. You will also critically evaluate the legal and ethical considerations for investigators in managing criminal investigations and understanding the wider strategic issues faced by the Investigator including the role of the Prosecuting Authority.</p>
<p><strong>Intelligence Sharing and Cooperation</strong></p>
<p>The failure to share information with others can undermine the effectiveness of operations and investigations, sometimes fatally. Even though the benefits of intelligence sharing have been well evidenced, this module will consider why information sharing still appears to be a recurring problem across agencies. This module explores how intelligence sharing mechanisms have developed over time, locally, nationally and internationally. It will critically assess the legislative provision underpinning the management of information and explore the barriers and enablers to effective sharing and cooperation within and across organisations.</p>
<p><strong>Intelligence Oversight Mechanisms</strong></p>
<p>The 9/11 attacks, the terrorist attacks in London, the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby, and the War in Iraq and the weapons of mass destruction have all led to inquiries into how the intelligence and law enforcement agencies collected, handled and used intelligence. This module examines the role of Intelligence oversight and its application at local, regional and national operating levels. This module will explore what effective oversight may look like and asks why is oversight so important to intelligence agencies and law enforcement.  It addresses other critical questions including; What happens if oversight is ineffective? What is the capacity and expertise required to deliver effective and meaningful oversight? What undermines effective oversight? The module critically examines and compares both UK and USA oversight mechanisms. It will show that legislative or parliamentary scrutiny, if undertaken effectively, can ensure intelligence agencies not only attract the resources required but can deploys these efficiently and ethically.  The module, recognising that scrutiny it not just the domain of the State, also examines the important role played by the media in oversight.</p>                                </div>

                    <h4>This programme is also available as a 240 credit routeway studied over two years. Students who choose this option will undertake a group design project and dissertation.</h4>
                    <ul>
    <li>Study a ground-breaking curriculum linked to industry needs </li>
    <li>Use industry standard tools and methodologies
        </li>
    <li>Undertake an extended project using real world data science problems</li>
    <li>Learn from academics who are world-leading researchers</li>
    <li>Use the programme as a basis for PhD study</li>
</ul>
<p>Data Science is an emerging discipline that aims to extract unique insights by extending the field of statistics to incorporate advances in computing, particularly in relation to large quantities of data.</p>
<p>It is estimated that 90% of the world's data was created in the last two years and that each day, over 2.5 billion gigabytes of data is created. Between 2012 and 2017 the take up of big data analytics amongst large enterprises in the UK more than doubled from 14% to 29%. The number of big data specialist staff working in large firms is predicted to increase by 243% to approximately 69,000 employees.</p>
<p>The challenges in data science are multi-faceted and very complex in their nature, including handling the huge amount of data in incompatible legacy databases.  By exploiting cloud computing services, data scientists are now relatively free from the constraints of hardware and can concentrate on applying their domain knowledge and experience to make sense of the data. They can apply advanced statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms to make informed decisions which can deliver a major impact on their organisations. The programme comprises six core modules covering statistical and computing techniques plus an extended research project. It is designed to give you the knowledge to move into the world of work as a qualified Data Scientist or to carry out further research through a PhD or equivalent. It is delivered via a combination of lectures, tutorials and and hands-on computer laboratory sessions. A major component of the MSc programme is the research project module, which will give you the opportunity to work on a high-level original research topic, with guidance from an experienced researcher and supervisor. </p>

                    <h2> </h2>
                    <p>The new 240 credit route includes a Group Design Project which aims to apply data science to the solution of a real-world problem. This will help to consolidate knowledge and skills learned during the first year, as well as develop new ones. </p>
<p>
<strong>Why should I choose the 2 year route?</strong> </p>
<ul>
    <li>The Group Design Project will provide an opportunity to use the tools and systems that data scientists and data engineers use, increasing your readiness for the job market.  </li>
    <li>This route will equip you with the transferrable project management skills needed to excel in your chosen career. </li>
    <li>You will work in groups and meet regularly with an academic supervisor and any internal or external stakeholders in order to develop an effective team-working ethic. </li>
    <li>You will present your work through regular meetings with your supervisor as well as submitting progress reports and oral presentations. In this way you will have the chance to hone your communicative skills and leave University ready for the workplace.<br>

                        The BSc (Hons) Climate Change with Foundation Year is the ideal course if you are interested in this subject but lack the necessary qualifications to study it at degree level. Climate Change is a pressing and challenging issue facing society. Rising temperatures and sea levels, near global retreat of glaciers, alterations to precipitation patterns and frequent extreme weather events, climate induced changes in biogeographical patterns and loss of biodiversity pose severe threats to contemporary and future societies. The introduction of this new BSc in Climate Change will allow students to investigate the issue using interdisciplinary skills.

                        <p><strong>Research in action</strong></p>
<p>LJMU academics worked alongside an artist to create a board game that brings the experiences of life on probation to the general public.</p>
<p>Exhibiting work in one of the country’s leading modern art galleries is not a typical experience for Criminologists, but academics from within LJMU's Criminal Justice and Criminology departments can now add this to their list of achievements. Alongside artist Hwa Young Jung, the team revealed a thought-provoking, interactive art piece – a board game entitled, Probationary: The Game of Life on Licence – at the Tate Modern for The Production of Truth, Justice and History exhibition hosted by the University of Warwick.</p>
<p>Produced through workshops with men on licence, Probationary explores the lived experience of being on probation. The board game format enables players to follow the journey of four characters as they work through the complexities of the probation process.</p>
<p>Board games, from Monopoly to the Game of Life, contain the structures and values of the society in which they are produced – presenting back to us the world in which we live. Taking this as a starting point, Probationary reflects real experiences of being subject to the criminal justice system and presents an opportunity to collectively play, understand and discuss such systems within contemporary society.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Study hours</strong></p>
<p>The programme is in two parts: a two-year taught element followed by a two and a half year thesis phase.<br>
<br>
In response to Covid-19, the first part is delivered via bootcamps (Friday evening/Saturday all day), which take place once a month from September (exact dates will be confirmed and the frequency may vary slightly). <br>
<br>
The second part involves working closely with a supervisor in the development, management and writing of a significant piece of research. </p>                                        <p><strong>Teaching methods</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>contribute to the creation of new knowledge through original research and other aspects of advanced scholarship</li>
    <li>extend the forefront of educational practice by producing academic work that merits publication</li>

                                <p></p><p>To cater for the wide-ranging content of our courses and the varied learning preferences of our students, we offer a range of assessment methods on each programme. Assessment techniques vary from module to module to reflect relevant assessment approaches and the key learning points of each topic.</p>
<p>Two of the major assessed pieces in the taught phase will 'mimic' journal articles with the expectation that the material submitted should be of publishable quality. You will be encouraged to follow up your success in these tasks by submitting the pieces to peer-reviewed journals. Additional assessment tasks include a presentation and aligned reflection on professional identity. <span style=""font-size: 1rem; font-family: helvetica-light, Arial, sans-serif;"">Finally, you will submit a research proposal, designed to prepare you for working on your thesis.</span></p>
<p>The thesis is 60,000 word document, which is complemented by a 5,000 word reflection on your learning in an academic and professional context. Your reflection will also discuss the practical applications of your thesis findings, and will be assessed by a viva voce (oral examination).</p>
<p>The assessment strategy is based on skills and intellectual preparation for the thesis phase, along with an emphasis on factors associated with the dissemination.</p>

                                <h4>How learning is monitored on your programme</h4>
                                <p></p><p>To cater for the wide-ranging content of our courses and the varied learning preferences of our students, we offer a range of assessment methods on each programme. Assessment techniques vary from module to module to reflect relevant assessment approaches and the key learning points of each topic.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: helvetica-light, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1rem; font-weight: bold;"">In the first unit you will be assessed on your ability to meet a range of agreed learning outcomes, demonstrated through the development of a series of assignments, including a presentation and essay. </span><br></p>
<p>This first unit will assess your capacity for professional development, review of knowledge and skills relating to the use of advanced research techniques.<br>
</p>
<p>Before proceeding to stage two, the work submitted for this module will be assessed and the credit awarded in accordance with the Academic Framework.</p>
<p>Assessment of the 30 credit Planning Module will include a short report. This will seek to justify the rationale for the project activities planned within the Doctoral Phase, indicating how each project is to be undertaken, describing the significant milestones to be achieved and including the completed learning agreement/research proposal for the whole Doctoral Phase. <br>
</p>
<p>The Investigative project and reflective module are assessed by viva voce examination of the thesis. The reflective module is there to ensure that students become effective research practitioners. They are able to reflect on their practice and therefore are able to see how academic work improves their professional learning and the practice of their organisations. <br>
</p>
<p>The investigative project module and reflective module will be approved as suitable for submission for viva voce examination by the supervisory team.</p>                        </div>

                    <h2>About this course</h2>
                    <h4>LJMU’s DBA provides senior executives and managers with the opportunity to achieve the highest academic degree while remaining in full-time employment.</h4>
                    <ul>
    <li>Equivalent to a PhD, the DBA is ideal for those who would like a doctoral level qualification whilst remaining in their chosen professional career  </li>
    <li>Focus on situational issues from your own workplace, whilst continuing your employment</li>
    <li>Enhance not only your ability to develop new knowledge, but also the ability to apply that knowledge to a professional context</li>
    <li>Gain the necessary skills to carry out rigorous research</li>
    <li>Carry out individual projects that impact on your organisation and industry</li>
    <li>Undertake your research amongst a carefully-selected, highly diverse group of professionals, drawn from a wide range of nationalities, industries, cultures and backgrounds</li>
    <li>Develop your skills and meet your supervisors at a number of residential workshops in Liverpool </li>
</ul>
<p>Join a cohort of senior professionals and apply your research directly to the needs of your business, driving forward organisational progress without putting your learning or your business on hold. You will contribute to commercial and academic knowledge and, on graduation, will possess a specialist range of problem solving and decision making strategies that will take you to the next level of success.</p>
<p style=""font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-size: medium;"">The DBA at Liverpool Business School is unique in its design and structure and the level of support it provides to the candidates. It has been running successfully for 10 years.</p>
<p>The programme will be of particular benefit to experienced business professionals. A DBA will enhance professional capability and credibility, enable you to develop networks, and provide a firm foundation for further career development or a major career move. Employers benefit from supporting candidates for the DBA by attracting, developing and retaining key talent and building knowledge for competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Liverpool Business School is a member of the Executive DBA Council (EDBAC) and, as such, we believe in fostering excellence and innovation in executive doctoral degree programmes.</p>
<p>The DBA will enable you to develop a sound understanding of the relevant conceptual and theoretical underpinnings of your chosen are of research into business and management.  By learning research techniques for advanced academic and management enquiry you will be able to carry out your own original research. In becoming a reflective practitioner you will enhance your professional practice, as well as contribute to theory and practice in business and management. </p>
<p>In contrast to a PhD, a DBA requires a contribution to both theory and practice. Candidates on the DBA are therefore required to demonstrate that they make an impact on the development of a profession and/or an organisation. </p>
<p>This impact can be demonstrated within the organisation the candidate is employed in or in another organisation, including professional bodies or policy. This close link to industry and practice can be highly beneficial for the employer too, with many previous DBA research projects resulting in large financial savings for organisations that candidates implemented them in. </p>

                                            <h4>Discover the building blocks of your programme</h4>
                                            <p></p><p>Your programme is made up of a number of core modules which are part of the course framework. Some programmes also have optional modules that can be selected to enhance your learning in certain areas and many feature a dissertation, extended report or research project to demonstrate your advanced learning.</p>
<p>The design is based on two principles:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Allow full-time professionals from all over the world to undertake doctoral studies part-time.</li>
    <li>Provide the full-time professionals with the necessary skills, knowledge, tools and techniques to undertake high quality research on a doctoral level and contributing to their professional practice. </li>
</ol>
<p>
</p>
<p>Based on these two principles we've designed the following structure: </p>
<p><strong>Year 1</strong></p>
<p>Two residential workshops (taught elements) each 5 days long will take place in Liverpool. These workshops focus on the planning process of the research, on refining the topic and basic research methods.</p>
<p><strong>Year 2 and 3</strong></p>
<p>One 5-day residential workshops, will take place in Liverpool. These workshops focus on the execution of the research, i.e. data collection and analysis, but also on a dissemination and impact strategy, as well as academic writing and viva preparation. </p>
<p><strong>Year 4 </strong></p>
<p>Our experience shows that DBA candidates typically take four years to complete their thesis, whereas the maximum duration of the programme is seven years. After year 3 no further residential workshops take place; this is a time for independent study, writing up your thesis, and examination.</p>

                                <p></p><p>To cater for the wide-ranging content of our courses and the varied learning preferences of our students, we offer a range of assessment methods on each programme. Assessment techniques vary from module to module to reflect relevant assessment approaches and the key learning points of each topic.</p>
<p>There are various assessments throughout the programme.</p>
<p>During the first year students are required to submit the research proposal (approx. 5K words), learning agreement (approx. 3K words) and LJMU Ethical approval form. Year 2 and year 3 are for students to write their thesis (approx. 80K words), complete their reflective report and publish papers. The thesis can be submitted at the earliest after completion of year 3.</p>
<p>The assessment of the thesis takes place in form of an oral examination undertaken by two examiners, who are experts in your field. One examiner is from LJMU and one is external.&amp;</p>                        </div>

                                    <p><strong>Study hours</strong></p>
<p>The English Literature programme at LJMU benefits from expertise in a wide variety of research areas: early modern cultures, romanticism, nineteenth-century print cultures, contemporary literature and culture, national literatures (especially Irish, Scottish and American) and postcolonial and world literatures.<span style=""font-size: 1rem; font-weight: bold; font-family: helvetica-light, Arial, sans-serif;""></span></p>                                        <p><strong>Teaching methods</strong></p>
<p>Staff in English have published recent books on seventeenth-century theatre, Sherlock Holmes, the 1950s, madness and the romantic poet, women travellers in Norway, shyness, housing, emigrant experience, betrayal, Irish music, the postcolonial intellectual, the cultural memory of Atlantic slavery and contemporary fictions of multiculturalism.</p>                                        <p><strong>Applied learning</strong></p>
<p>Staff are involved in a number of large-scale collaborative projects such as the building of a replica Elizabethan theatre at Prescot (Shakespeare North), the Archive of Working-Class Writing, the Liverpool Travel Studies Seminar, the War Widows Project and the Marginal Irish Modernisms network. In the most recent research assessment (REF2014), 22% of our research was rated as world leading and 46% as internationally excellent. 50% of our research was rated world-leading for public impact.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>                        </div>

The awards are intended to help you undertake significant domestic or international travel in support of your work and personal development. The awards aren't necessarily about academic study, instead they focus on the spirit of travel and adventure.

                                    <p><strong>Study hours</strong></p>
<p>The majority of teaching takes place on Monday and Tuesday, via a modular programme of study. </p>                                        <p><strong>Teaching methods</strong></p>
<p>This programme offers a blend of theory and practice. It will enable you to focus on your own specialist area of fashion, in disciplines such as communication, editorial, branding, campaign, trend prediction, retail solutions, photography, language, design, garment production, textiles and fabrication development.
Teaching is individually tailored around each student. Weeks are divided between tutorials, seminars, studio supervisions and workshops.</p>                                        <p><strong>Applied learning</strong></p>
<p>The MA has been developed specifically to allow individuals to build relevant real-world projects which challenge and/or find solutions for issues within the broader field of fashion.<br>
<br>
You will be encouraged to innovate through a series of self-initiated and taught components - including studio and collaborative practice - before completing a major project around your chosen specialism. You will also have opportunities to undertake field trips to further enhance your learning experience.</p>                        </div>

<h3>Bursaries and study awards</h3>
<p>The Liverpool School of Art and Design offers students across all taught postgraduate programmes opportunities to apply for scholarships aimed at broadening student knowledge and experience.</p>
<p>The Michael Pugh Thomas and Julia Carter Preston Legacy scholarships consist of a number of £1,000 awards and are open to full-time and part-time home and international students who wish to study for a postgraduate qualification in art and design with LJMU. Part-time applicants can only apply once over the two years of their course.</p>
<p>To be considered for the scholarship, you must submit a 500 word letter to <a href=""mailto:apsadmissions@ljmu.ac.uk"" target=""_blank"">apsadmissions@ljmu.ac.uk</a> after being formally offered a place on a Masters programme in the School of Art and Design. <strong>The application deadline to be considered for the Scholarship for entry onto a programme in September is 30 June.</strong></p>
<p>Please ensure you include your name, contact details, the full title of the course you have applied to study on and 500 words stating why you should be awarded the scholarship, the benefits it will bring to your studies and any exceptional circumstances you face in studying for a postgraduate qualification. Further information for international students about finance, fees and scholarships <a href=""/discover/fees-and-funding"">can be found here</a>.</p>
<p>The School's main travel bursary for existing students, The Susan Cotton Travel Awards, consists of three European Awards of £1,600 and two International Awards of £2,300. The awards are intended to help you undertake significant domestic or international travel in support of your work and personal development. The awards aren't necessarily about academic study, instead they focus on the spirit of travel and adventure. Previous winners of the bursary have travelled to a tropical island to experience life at its most basic, cycled the length of the Danube, spent a month in Morocco and inter-railed through Europe. <strong><br>

<p>Join a small group of students from a diverse range of backgrounds to develop your practice within a global context. You will benefit from a high level of discussion and reflection, test your artistic thinking, create exhibitions, events and collaborations. </p>
<strong>
</strong>
<p>We bring to the discussion of your work our expertise as artists with an established international exhibition practice. From our base in the shared cross-MA studio, we work in a number of architecturally diverse sites across the city for short projects and public-facing exhibitions. We see exhibition making as a medium to push your practice; to take risks, experiment and hone your professional skills. We invite curators and leading artists from the UK and internationally, to join us in crits and assessments. In many of these projects you take the lead, with our support – from scouting and negotiating sites to marketing and promotion. In doing so you are also building a professional network which will be invaluable to you after you graduate.</p>

<h3>Bursaries and study awards</h3>
<p>The Liverpool School of Art and Design offers students across all taught postgraduate programmes opportunities to apply for scholarships aimed at broadening student knowledge and experience.</p>
<p>The Michael Pugh Thomas and Julia Carter Preston Legacy scholarships consist of a number of £1,000 awards and are open to full-time and part-time home and international students who wish to study for a postgraduate qualification in art and design with LJMU. Part-time applicants can only apply once over the two years of their course.</p>
<p>To be considered for the scholarship, you must submit a 500 word letter to <a href=""mailto:apsadmissions@ljmu.ac.uk"" target=""_blank"">apsadmissions@ljmu.ac.uk</a> after being formally offered a place on a Masters programme in the School of Art and Design. <strong>The application deadline to be considered for the Scholarship for entry onto a programme in September is 30 June.</strong></p>
<p>Please ensure you include your name, contact details, the full title of the course you have applied to study on and 500 words stating why you should be awarded the scholarship, the benefits it will bring to your studies and any exceptional circumstances you face in studying for a postgraduate qualification. Further information for international students about finance, fees and scholarships <a href=""/discover/fees-and-funding"">can be found here</a>.</p>
<p>The School's main travel bursary for existing students, The Susan Cotton Travel Awards, consists of three European Awards of £1,600 and two International Awards of £2,300. The awards are intended to help you undertake significant domestic or international travel in support of your work and personal development. The awards aren't necessarily about academic study, instead they focus on the spirit of travel and adventure. Previous winners of the bursary have travelled to a tropical island to experience life at its most basic, cycled the length of the Danube, spent a month in Morocco and inter-railed through Europe. <strong><br>

<p> </p>
<p>The MSc in Forensic Anthropology provides the skills and knowledge required to pursue a career in the search for missing people, the recovery of evidence and human remains from clandestine graves and the identification of unknown corpses by osteological analysis. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Your studies will develop a broad understanding of these issues, including excavation, laboratory analysis and the courtroom skills necessary to present findings in a trial. You will learn analytical techniques, taphonomic analysis, field methods and genetic applications, as well as having the unique opportunity to excavate and analyse human remains during archaeological excavations at the Poulton Project archaeological site near Chester.</p>

You will operate in a range of science contexts, taking responsibility for your contributions and outputs and generating information using primary observations of human osteology. You will use this information to form responses to the problems presented.</p>
<p>You will be taught in new human osteology laboratories, which house osteology collections and specialist equipment for digital radiography and 3-dimensional imaging, such as laser scanners and microscribes for advanced morphometric studies.</p>

    <li>Combine practical filmmaking and film criticism</li>
    <li>Choose between practical and theoretical assignments</li>
    <li>Embed your learning within an academic and film industry-based

    <li>Learn from staff with a broad range of research specialisms, including practical
    filmmaking, academic writing, screenwriting and producing video essays</li>
</ul>
<p>Studying on this new MA affords you the opportunity to study in one of the UK’s most dynamic cities. Liverpool is the second most filmed in city after London and has a vibrant media and cultural industry.

                    <h2> </h2>
                    <p>This forward-looking MA prepares you for bridging the traditional gap between theory and practice, by inviting you to both ‘think’ and ‘do’ film, thus bringing down barriers and forging new approaches to the analysis and production of films.</p>
<p>The MA Film promotes an experimental approach that considers film as a tool for research and a means for understanding, exploring and representing the world. The programme will build a cohort of practice-informed academics, and theory-informed practitioners, while offering the opportunity to study in a dynamic city with a burgeoning film industry.</p>

<p><em><strong>Melissa Goodrich is studying MA Graphic Design and Illustration. Talking about the course, Melissa said: ""The degree has helped me establish my practice and narrow down my skillset. I want to work in TV and Film as a graphic designer, as it’s such a huge passion of mine. The facilities available to students have aided my practice, like being able to use the laser cutter to create my own vintage style stamps. The module ‘collaborative practice’ seemed to be the most daunting, sharing your ideas with someone else can be quite scary. But I found it the most rewarding experience.""</strong></em></p>

<h3>Bursaries and study awards</h3>
<p>The Liverpool School of Art and Design offers students across all taught postgraduate programmes opportunities to apply for scholarships aimed at broadening student knowledge and experience.</p>
<p>The Michael Pugh Thomas and Julia Carter Preston Legacy scholarships consist of a number of £1,000 awards and are open to full-time and part-time home and international students who wish to study for a postgraduate qualification in art and design with LJMU. Part-time applicants can only apply once over the two years of their course.</p>
<p>To be considered for the scholarship, you must submit a 500 word letter to <a href=""mailto:apsadmissions@ljmu.ac.uk"" target=""_blank"">apsadmissions@ljmu.ac.uk</a> after being formally offered a place on a Masters programme in the School of Art and Design. <strong>The application deadline to be considered for the scholarship for entry into a programme in September is 30 June.</strong></p>
<p>Please ensure you include your name, contact details, the full title of the course you have applied to study on and 500 words stating why you should be awarded the scholarship, the benefits it will bring to your studies and any exceptional circumstances you face in studying for a postgraduate qualification. Further information for international students about finance, fees and scholarships <a href=""/discover/fees-and-funding"">can be found here</a>.</p>

The awards are intended to help you undertake significant domestic or international travel in support of your work and personal development. The awards aren't necessarily about academic study, instead they focus on the spirit of travel and adventure. Previous winners of the bursary have travelled to a tropical island to experience life at its most basic, cycled the length of the Danube, spent a month in Morocco and inter-railed through Europe. <strong><strong>Applications for September 2019 entry are now closed.</strong><br>

    <li>Prepare for a career as an innovative and creative teacher of 3-7 or 5-11 year olds (see Details tab for range of courses)</li>
    <li>Enjoy placements supported by excellent teacher mentors</li>
    <li>Qualify with a Postgraduate Diploma in Education featuring 120 Masters-level credits (ours is one of the few ITT courses to offer this) and Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) for the same cost and length of study as a PGCE</li>
    <li>Spend 120 days on school placement, predominantly in a ‘Home School’</li>
    <li>Go on to complete your MA in your first year of employment and look forward to excellent career development opportunities</li>
</ul>
<p>Our PGDE Primary programmes are designed to prepare you for a career as an innovative and creative teacher. You will be trained by highly experienced academic staff and school mentors.</p>
<p>At Foundation level our philosophy centres around a commitment to learning and teaching through play and interaction. This should not be seen as a ‘soft option’, but as a challenging and rigorous approach, which requires
high level planning, organisation, intervention and assessment.</p>
<p>Training to teach the 5-11 age range, on the other hand, focuses on lectures and workshops which will enable you to explore pedagogical approaches to teaching and learning across all National Curriculum subjects with a particular focus on the core subjects, including the teaching of Phonics.</p>
<p>The professional experience you acquire during your studies, alongside University input will enable you to develop your ability to plan, teach and manage learning in different settings and socio-economic contexts.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Study hours</strong></p>
<p>The support and guidance of the dedicated, enthusiastic and incredibly knowledgeable staff helps create a unique learning environment that encourages independent study. Full-time students will study every Monday and Wednesday across both semesters, while part-time students will only study half of the required number of taught modules each year.</p>                                        <p><strong>Teaching methods</strong></p>
<p>Technology plays a crucial role in learning through this programme and modules use online feedback and face-to-face assessments. The programme's blended learning techniques include: interactive, self-directed and independent learning, lecturer-produced course documents, collaboration and cohort learning through online forums or group working.<br>
</p>
<p>Teaching is usually delivered via seminars and workshops in the Redmonds Building, and you will need to undertake some preliminary reading to prepare for and take part in group discussions.</p>                        </div>

                                <h4>An insight into teaching on your course</h4>
                                    <p><strong>Study hours</strong></p>
<p>University-based study includes: </p>
<ul style=""list-style-type: disc;"">
    <li>a full-time block of three weeks at the start of the course in September</li>
    <li>one day per week until January</li>
    <li>six one-week study blocks at university between October and June</li>
    <li>a number of conference days throughout the year</li>
</ul>
<p>You will undertake a significant amount of independent study and preparation to support your course assignments and school-based work (planning, preparation and assessment); and should be prepared to work some evenings and weekends.</p>                                        <p><strong>Teaching methods</strong></p>
<p>You will be taught in lead lectures, workshops and seminars, involving group discussion and reflection, problem solving and micro-teaching. You will also make use of our online virtual learning environment.</p>
<p>You will be allocated a School-based Mentor, who will organise and supervise your school-based training. Your Mentor will be supported by your LJMU tutor who will visit your school several times to monitor your progress. Additional professional development sessions are organised in school during placements. </p>
<p>Tutorial support is an important part of the LJMU learning process and you will receive a personalised service that will enable you to set targets and achieve your potential. Your LJMU Tutor will support your academic and professional development and will meet with you formally during the year.</p>
<p>The University element of the programme is based around modules focusing on developing theory and practice. They will cover areas such as: </p>
<ul>
    <li>critiquing effective approaches to learning, teaching and assessment in your subject</li>
</ul>                        </div>

    <li>promoting inclusive, engaging and impactful sequences of lessons to meet the diverse needs all learners</li>
    <li>informed and deliberate use of educational research methods to improve learning</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Applied learning</strong></p>
<p>You will spend 120 days on school placement.</p>
<p>Placements are organised, by our Work-Based Learning Unit, in our Partnership schools in the Greater Merseyside area. For the majority of the training you will gain your teaching experience in a ‘Home School’ with a shorter ‘Alternate Placement’ in a different school setting in January/February. This innovative model ensures you feel genuinely part of the staff whilst on school placement and can monitor and gain satisfaction from your impact on your pupils’ progress over time.</p>
<p>School-based training involves the preparation and delivery of learning sequences and lessons to small groups and whole classes of learners, with expectations and workload increasing during the course. This work is supported by a school-based Teacher-mentor, who will enhance your professional learning experience in school, and your LJMU Tutor.</p>                        </div>

                                <h4>How learning is monitored on your programme</h4>
                                <p></p><p>To cater for the wide-ranging content of our courses and the varied learning preferences of our students, we offer a range of assessment methods on each programme. Assessment techniques vary from module to module to reflect relevant assessment approaches and the key learning points of each topic.</p>
<p>PGDE assessment methods include: critical reflections on theory and practice, engaging with practitioner enquiry (as both a consumer and producer of research), the design and evaluation of learning experiences, and presentations.</p>
<p>On your placement, you will need to monitor your progression towards achieving the professional standards required for Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) and to maintain a professional development portfolio associated with these.</p>
<p>A final assessment of your achievement of the Teachers’ Standards required will be based on co-observation and assessment of your teaching practice, with your mentor and tutor, and the evidence of pupils’ learning and progress in the classes that you teach.</p>                        </div>

<p>The Rice-Jones Charitable Trust was set up by an individual who wanted to benefit postgraduate law students studying in the North-West of England. The lady’s late husband and her father were both lawyers.

The The Rice-Jones Charitable Trust is registered with the Charity Commission: charity 117189. <a href=""http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityFramework.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1171890&amp;amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0"" target=""_blank"">View the full details</a>.</p>
<p>The Rice-Jones Scholarship will be offered to applicants who have accepted a place to study on a postgraduate law course including, but not limited to, the Graduate Diploma in Law, the Legal Practice Course, the Bar Professional Training Course or the Masters in Law.</p>
<p>For all 2021/22 applications, each award will total between £250 and £1500 towards study expenses. Awards granted will depend on the applications received.</p>

<p>For all 2021/22 applications, each award will total between £250 and £1500 towards study expenses. Awards granted will depend on the applications received.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Study hours</strong></p>
<p>Your study hours depend entirely on the option modules you decide to study. Typically, for the first semester, your study pattern will include two study days: Mondays and Wednesdays.</p>                                        <p><strong>Teaching methods</strong></p>
<p>The first semester introduces you to the institutions that shape the regulations and laws governing business, the justification for regulatory and legal intervention, as well as the content and operation of specific lines of regulation and law. In semester one, you will choose three law electives from a tailored menu of options. These modules act as the fulcrum for the programme as a whole. In the second semester, you will select two electives from Liverpool Business School’s portfolio of option modules. Against the legal background developed in the first semester, you will explore a variety of fascinating questions affecting businesses with a strong emphasis on practice and applications to business management problems.</p>                                        <p><strong>Applied learning</strong></p>
<p>Learning will be divided between the School of Law and Liverpool Business School and will include various seminar and workshop settings, where students and academics will discuss issues relating to the key module learning outcomes.</p>                        </div>

                    <h4>This Advanced Practice course combines both the theoretical learning of Investment and Finance and the practical application of it through a real consultancy project. </h4>
                    <ul>
    <li>Prepare for a range of careers in finance <br></li>
    <li>Learn to think strategically about finance with an emphasis on research and critical analysis</li>
    <li>Benefit from academic expertise in a variety of financial management disciplines</li>
</ul>
<p>The field of investment and finance forms part of the structure of all organisations and the general health of the economy. In every arena, the effective financial investment and management of funds enables businesses to operate successfully, achieving and exceeding their set goals. Engaging in this course of study will provide you with a perennial skillset, and a valuable piece of professional development if you are looking to take your career to the next level of responsibility, and salary bracket. </p>
<p>The overall aim of the MSc Investment and Finance programme is to produce postgraduates who are able to make a valid and meaningful contribution within the field of finance. This will be achieved by exposing you to the current theories, concepts and developments within this discipline and, by doing so, you will become competent and thoughtful practitioners.</p>
<p>You will develop an understanding of the interpretation, uses, and analysis of financial and investment information in a practical domestic and international context. Your reflective, critical and evaluative thinking will be improved through exposure to contemporary and current issues in finance and via teaching and learning that is strongly supported by research and professional practice.</p>
<p>This intellectually challenging programme of study will focus on current issues, themes, and applications within the field of finance and financial management. Your analytical, critical and problem-solving skills will be extended through the academic evaluation of literature and current financial practices.</p><p style=""font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-size: medium;""><span style=""font-family: helvetica-light, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: bold;"">During the second year of the course, you and your fellow students will undertake a semester-long group consultancy project, working on a project brief provided by a business. This project enables you to apply the theoretical knowledge you have learned and gain workplace experience at the same time.</span><br></p>

                    <h4>LJMU's Legal Practice Course produces highly skilled, commercially aware and effective Trainee Solicitors, prepared for the demands of a Training Contract.</h4>
                    <ul>
    <li>Long running course with an established reputation</li>
    <li>Highly experienced team of tutors, including current practitioners</li>
    <li>Established links with the local legal profession, leading to job opportunities for graduates</li>
    <li>Commended pastoral support during your studies, personal tutors and subject tutors all offering an open door to deal with issues quickly and appropriately</li>
    <li>Flexible part-time study routes</li>
    <li>Generous funding scholarships available for home and overseas students</li>
</ul>
<p>The School of Law is dedicated to enabling its students to become highly effective trainee solicitors through our well respected Legal Practice Course (LPC). As an LPC student, you will join an established professional legal network and continue your professional development with experts across a variety of legal fields. The opportunity to combine the study of legal practice to meet Solicitors Regulation Authority requirements with the creation of a dissertation reflecting extensive research into your chosen area of law will enhance your personal development and your chances of securing employment within a very competitive legal profession.</p>
<p>The Solicitors Regulation Authority is proposing to change the route individuals must take to qualify as a solicitor.</p>
<p>The proposal is to create a new national assessment in two parts, covering elements of the current qualifying law degree (QLD) and the current LPC. That assessment will be implemented nationally in 2020 and will stand alone; students will then have to decide how they will undertake the vast amount of learning required to pass the assessment. Higher Education Institutions and private providers are currently planning how they will develop learning programmes to support the new assessment. </p>
<p>The School of Law has over 25 years’ experience delivering academic and vocational courses in Law, making us ideally placed to deliver high quality learning opportunities aimed at meeting the new assessment criteria.</p>
<p>Our LPC has run since 1994 and more than 1100 of our graduates have embarked on successful careers within the legal profession. Many have joined our established employer network and keep in touch with us via Facebook. When you join our LPC you join an established community of legal professionals. </p>

                    <h2> </h2>
                    <p>We provide extensive networking and work-placement opportunities, including enhanced work experience via our Solicitor Mentor Scheme and voluntary legal case work as part of the <a href=""/error?item=web%3a%7b8888546A-ECBA-4E0B-B7E6-A36DD138643A%7d%40en"">School of Law's Legal Advice Centre</a>. The dissertation element of the course provides the opportunity to enhance your career prospects through acquiring vocationally relevant knowledge. It will enable you to make a significant and measurable contribution to the body of legal knowledge in your chosen subject.</p>
<h4>“I loved the LPC at LJMU.  The facilities in the Redmonds Building are first rate, and the course tutors were fantastic.  Not only do they bring in-depth knowledge to the subjects, but also practical real-world experience. Highly recommended.” </h4>

<h3>Rice-Jones Scholarship</h3>
<p>The Rice-Jones Charitable Trust was set up by an individual who wanted to benefit postgraduate law students studying in the North-West of England. The lady’s late husband and her father were both lawyers. This has inspired her to help students who show academic promise and a commitment to the legal profession, yet who may not have the financial support to undertake their studies. The The Rice-Jones Charitable Trust is registered with the Charity Commission: charity 117189. <a href=""http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityFramework.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1171890&amp;amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0"" target=""_blank"">View the full details</a>.</p>
<p>The Rice-Jones Scholarship will be offered to applicants who have accepted a place to study on a postgraduate law course including, but not limited to, the Graduate Diploma in Law, the Legal Practice Course, the Bar Professional Training Course or the Masters in Law.</p>
<p>For all 2021/22 applications, each award will total between £250 and £1500 towards study expenses. Awards granted will depend on the applications received.</p>
<p>The deadline for applications is 1 May 2021. <a href=""/~/media/files/ljmu/courses/postgraduate/scholarships/application-form-2021.docx?la=en"" target=""_blank"">Download your application form</a> and view the <a href=""/~/media/files/ljmu/courses/postgraduate/scholarships/terms-and-conditions-2021.docx?la=en"" target=""_blank"">terms and conditions</a>.</p>                </div>

                        <h4>Further your career prospects</h4>
                        <p>LJMU has an excellent employability record with 96% <span style=""font-size: small;"">(HESA 2017)</span> of our postgraduates in work or further study six months after graduation. Our applied learning techniques and strong industry connections ensure our students are fully prepared for the workplace on graduation and understand how to apply their knowledge in a real world context.</p>


                        <p>The LPC is a prescribed stage in qualification as a solicitor in England and Wales. There are a very broad range of opportunities for employment within the legal profession. In 2018 there are over 142,000 practising solicitors and the Law Society Gazette currently has over 4800 vacancies listed.<br>
<br>
Students often worry whether they will find a training contract which will enable them to complete their qualification. The good news for students at LJMU is that, outside of London, the greatest number of training contracts are offered in the North West. </p>

<p>Our academic team have designed your assessed work around the needs of the legal profession to ensure that you fulfil your potential at this important stage of your development. The form of assessment for the LPC element of the course is prescribed by the SRA and must be supervised. This means that core and option subjects are largely assessed by open-book examinations. Skills are assessed by way of coursework for drafting, practical legal research and writing, or by live role play assessment for advocacy and interviewing and advising. The LLM assessment is in two parts. An initial 2000 word research proposal followed by a 10,000 word dissertation.</p>                        </div>

                                <h4>An insight into teaching on your course</h4>
                                    <p><strong>Study hours</strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Apart from the consultancy project, each taught module will
consist of three full day face to face sessions per 10 credits. For example,
Leadership and Leader Development (20 credits) will be taught across six days.
In addition to the taught elements, students will spend time preparing for the
session and will also engage in follow up activities. An example is shown
below:<p></p></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><b>Leadership and Leader Development (7200LODMS)<p></p></b></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Credits: 20<p></p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Total learning hours: 200<p></p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Taught element: 48 hours<p></p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Private study: 152 hours<p></p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The private study element comprises of independent research, further reading, preparation for taught sessions, follow-up activities and assignment preparation and write-up. </p>                                        <p><strong>Teaching methods</strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Each module comprises of a number of workshops relating to the
credit tariff. This programme uses a flipped learning approach; students will
be sent resources via our virtual learning environment (VLE) in advance of the
session in order to be able to discuss key themes and concepts alongside their
peers. The VLE is also used as a key communication tool in between sessions and
follow up reading and activities are shared. <p></p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Teaching follows a seminar model and shared learning and peer
learning is strongly advocated. We promote the use of Action Learning Sets in
order to provide ongoing peer support throughout the programme and beyond. <p></p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">As this is a Level 7 course we encourage criticality and provide students with key texts for further discussion in sessions. We critically examine case studies, look at examples of successes and challenges within the real world and engage in simulation activities. We use a variety of tools to encourage self reflection. </p>                                        <p><strong>Applied learning</strong></p>
<div>
<p>At the centre of our philosophy is the notion that we learn best from experience and applying our learning, so action learning and coaching are a key part of our programmes. </p>
<p>This approach encourages strong peer learning groups where managers can learn from each other. Students are encouraged to share how learning has been applied and improved practice in their own workplace. </p>
<p>The programme is personalised to individuals and customised for businesses so that they can apply the necessary management practices to ensure that: </p>
<ul>
    <li>learning results in improved workplace performance </li>
    <li>skills are practiced and knowledge applied</li>
    <li>time away from work is kept to a minimum with learning happening in the workplace </li>
</ul>

This is a theme which runs through all modules. The final module of the programme is a Consultancy Project (7212LODMS). This is a 60 credit module and is the culmination of two years of study. The project is focused on a ‘real’ issue or theme from the workplace. The Research Methods module (7210LODMS) lays the foundation for this extended piece of independent research. <br></p>

                                    <p><strong>Study hours</strong></p>
<p>Apart from the consultancy project, each taught module will consist of three full day face to face sessions per 10 credits. For example, Leadership and Leader Development (20 credits) will be taught across six days. In addition to the taught elements, students will spend time preparing for the session and will also engage in follow up activities. An example is shown below:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Leadership and Leader Development (7200LODMS)</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Credits: 20</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Total learning hours: 200</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Taught element: 48 hours</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Private study: 152 hours</p>
<p>The private study element comprises of independent research, further reading, preparation for taught sessions, follow-up activities and assignment preparation and write-up.<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>                                        <p><strong>Teaching methods</strong></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Each module comprises of a number of workshops relating to the
credit tariff. This programme uses a flipped learning approach; students will
be sent resources via our virtual learning environment (VLE) in advance of the
session in order to be able to discuss key themes and concepts alongside their
peers. The VLE is also used as a key communication tool in between sessions and
follow up reading and activities are shared. <p></p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Teaching follows a seminar model and shared learning and peer
learning is strongly advocated. We promote the use of Action Learning Sets in
order to provide ongoing peer support throughout the programme and beyond. <p></p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">As this is a Level 7 course we encourage criticality and provide students with key texts for further discussion in sessions. We critically examine case studies, look at examples of successes and challenges within the real world and engage in simulation activities.  We use a variety of tools to encourage self reflection. </p>

<p>Increasing globalisation, deregulation, faster innovation cycles, digital transformation and accelerating economic integration have made markets more dynamic, competitive and digital - and above all, more complex. 
 
</p>
<p>
Digital technology is now of significant importance to organisations and on this course we consider how it can be applied. For the organisation, to become digital means not just consideration of new transformational-enabling technologies but also of human resources, business processes and strategy. On this course we cover mainstream management functions alongside digital business.</p>
<p>All organisations seek to improve performance. Managers are using digital advances as well as improving their use of traditional technologies to change customer relationships, internal processes and value propositions.  </p>

<p></p><div><p></p><p>At the centre of our philosophy is the notion that we learn best from experience and applying our learning, so action learning and coaching are a key part of our programmes. This approach also encourages strong peer learning groups where you can learn from your peers, in recognition of the fact that management and leadership development is a social and collaborative process.</p><p>We take learning from the workplace seriously. Consequently, everybody brings their experience from their area of expertise with them and you will be encouraged to share how your learning has been applied and improved practice in your workplace. The programme is personalised to individuals so that you can apply your learning to your own workplace projects and tasks. Learning approaches include:</p><p><strong>Recognising the workplace as an important place to learn</strong></p><p>Learners will apply ideas in the workplace, improving their skills through a range of workplace activities and then reflecting and reviewing this practice with peer on the programme. All the assessments are applied and related to the individuals’ own workplace.</p><p><strong>Self-development planning</strong></p><p>Organisational processes can be applied to ensure that individuals plan to develop their own strengths in line with business competencies and values, and to recognise their own personal needs.</p><p><strong>‘flipped learning’</strong></p><p>This reverses the conventional process of teaching by providing the content prior to the teaching and learning session using a virtual learning environment, so that the focus of the workshop becomes about active learning and application of theory to practice.</p><p>Coaching and peer-to-peer coaching. Coaching not only enables the individual learner to tailor the programme to meet their needs, but it also provides the opportunity for the organisation to propose business critical skills and values which can become a part of the development activities. It is important to develop skills in coaching others, as well as being supported by a coach. Therefore, peer coaching is incorporated to develop skills and practice as a coach with a peer on the programme.</p></div><div><p></p></div><p>                        </p>                        </div>

</strong><br>
This will be adopted as a supportive and collaborative approach to learning to manage. Action learning will be used to support personal development, where issues and challenges from the workplace can be discussed. This approach to management learning provides a forum to bring ideas, thoughts and issues and allow a collaborative learning process to develop ideas for action.<br>
<br>
<strong>Projects</strong><br>
<br>
For each theme there is the possibility of designing an in-company project or series of projects to ensure that business needs are met. It presents an opportunity for knowledge and skills to be applied to practice by delivering something of value to the organisation.<br>
<br>
<strong>Masterclasses<br>
</strong><br>
Where key note speakers address current issues, emerging practice and thought leadership. The intent is to foster the need to be continually updating and engaging with the ways in which management in organisation is changing. Depending on the delivery pattern agreed, there is potential for one key note for each of the themes.</p>

<h3>Rice-Jones Scholarship</h3>
<p>The Rice-Jones Charitable Trust was set up by an individual who wanted to benefit postgraduate law students studying in the North-West of England. The lady’s late husband and her father were both lawyers. This has inspired her to help students who show academic promise and a commitment to the legal profession, yet who may not have the financial support to undertake their studies. The The Rice-Jones Charitable Trust is registered with the Charity Commission: charity 117189. <a href=""http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityFramework.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1171890&amp;amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0"" target=""_blank"">View the full details</a>.</p>
<p>The Rice-Jones Scholarship will be offered to applicants who have accepted a place to study on a postgraduate law course including, but not limited to, the Graduate Diploma in Law, the Legal Practice Course, the Bar Professional Training Course or the Masters in Law.</p>
<p>For all 2021/22 applications, each award will total between £250 and £1500 towards study expenses. Awards granted will depend on the applications received.</p>

                        <h4>Further your career prospects</h4>
                        <p>LJMU has an excellent employability record with 96% <span style=""font-size: small;"">(HESA 2017)</span> of our postgraduates in work or further study six months after graduation. Our applied learning techniques and strong industry connections ensure our students are fully prepared for the workplace on graduation and understand how to apply their knowledge in a real world context.</p>


                        <p>Graduates with skills in natural drug discovery and hands-on experience in operating state-of-art equipment would be well placed in the pharmaceutical, phytopharmaceutical, chemical and biotechnological industries and also in the regulatory sector (for example, MHRA).  There is also an increasing demand for Masters level students in the general business sector. Skills such as formulating a well-justified case, using carefully assessed data sources, planning and executing projects etc are highly useful generic skills. Some graduates may prefer to continue their studies in the area of Natural Products at PhD level rather than embark on a career in industry.</p>

                    <h4>Enhance your business or contribute to organisational growth by learning scale up approaches on this Business MBA from LJMU.</h4>
                    <ul>
    <li>Study on a course designed in response to government and local ambitions for business growth  </li>
    <li>Start your studies in September or January </li>
    <li>Learn the key factors that enable business growth </li>
    <li>Enjoy extra flexibility and fit your studies around your existing commitments with part of the course taught via block learning</li>
    <li>Benefit from course content and teaching informed by proprietary business research and academics' close links to business</li>
</ul>
<p>A 'scale-up' is an enterprise that has experienced significant growth rates in employees and turnover over a number of years.</p>
<p>Nationally, scale-up businesses have been identified as a priority area, recognised by the appointment of a scale up champion in Government who aims to increase the number of businesses maximising opportunities to reach their growth potential. This will feed into the Government's industrial strategy.</p>
<p>MBAs equip managers with a broad and rich understanding of business, enabling them to manage effectively. This scale up MBA focuses on the key areas a business would need to investigate to assess scale up potential. The course combines key management disciplines from the key QAA and CMI benchmark statements with recent national research on the drivers of business scale up.</p>
<p>The programme is structured in three phases. The first phase provides an intensive focused range of interventions aimed at realising the potential of growth within businesses. Stages two and three then draw on these areas to analyse ideas and develop them further to plan and enable accelerated growth. Finally, a strategic project builds the evidence base for scale up strategies, and addresses a significant and strategic area for your business.</p>

<p>Techniques include:</p><p><strong>Recognising the workplace as an important place to learn</strong></p><p>Learners will apply ideas in the workplace, improving their skills through a range of workplace activities and then reflecting and reviewing this practice with peers on the programme.</p><p><strong>Self-development planning</strong></p><p>Organisational processes can be applied to ensure that individuals plan to develop their own strengths in line with business competencies and values, and to recognise their own personal needs.</p><p><strong>Using 'flipped learning'</strong></p><p>This reverses the conventional process of teaching by providing the content prior to the teaching and learning session using a virtual learning environment, so that the focus of the workshop becomes about active learning and application of theory to practice.</p><p><strong>Coaching and peer-to-peer coaching</strong></p><p>Coaching not only enables the individual learner to tailor the programme to meet their needs, but it also provides the opportunity for the organisation to propose business critical skills and values which can become a part of the development activities.</p>                        </div>

                    <p>During your studies you will learn to apply knowledge and understanding with originality and creativity for the re-interpretation of received assumptions regarding musical theatre performance. You will also gain the confidence to work creatively, collaboratively and collectively with musical theatre makers who possess varying levels of experience and styles.</p>
<p>​To develop your own creative practice as a musical theatre artist, you will learn how to effectively and appropriately employ a range of research methodologies and critical perspectives, including the ability to interrogate, evaluate and explore Musical Theatre ‘texts’ and processes. For students who wish to develop an entrepreneurial approach and set up their own theatre company, this MA will enable you to explore performance and event creation utilising organisational and managerial skills and industry knowledge.</p>
<p>""This course enables students to develop their skills in musical theatre to an expert level through conversations and experiments with faculty and colleagues. Students with various backgrounds and specialties, such as choreographers, directors, writers, and composers, gather to establish a community, work in projects together, inspire each other, and create synergy. While you follow the module structure and enjoy an academic journey, you will also develop your personal interests and specialties, as well as being able to focus on an area where you would like to pursue deeper expertise. As an international student, I was given multiple opportunities to test my unique ideas, derived from my cultural background, in writing musical scripts. In addition, I could expand my critical thinking in the frameworks that the course provides.""<br>

<p style=""background: white;""><span>​In addition, for those with backgrounds in composition, orchestration, playwriting, poetry, etc, it is an opportunity to apply those skills to the specific demands of the musical theatre’s dramatic and theatrical imperatives.</span></p><p style=""background: white;""><span style=""font-family: helvetica-light, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 700;"">For directors, choreographers and musical directors who have experience across their specific disciplines, the course provides the opportunity to hone more general techniques to the specific demands of the genre, acquiring new languages and processes in developing effective practice.</span><span><br></span></p>

<p><strong>New Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) Standards </strong></p>
<p>The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) is the professional body that evaluates and monitors all Nursing and Midwifery courses in the UK. Only education and training providers accredited by the NMC can deliver courses that lead to Qualified Nurse or Midwife status and registration with the NMC. </p>
<p>In 2018, the NMC released plans to update the standards for pre-registration nursing and midwifery programmes, starting after 28th January 2019. The new standards set out the entry requirements, length of programme, methods of assessment and the level of award. </p>
<p>To ensure that our programmes are at the forefront of nursing and midwifery education and meet the new standards, we've worked closely with our practice partners updating our course content and student assessment methods. This means you'll benefit from the most up to date, practice-informed learning.</p>
<p>​<strong>Additional course costs</strong></p>
<p>Travel costs to placements and parking if using a car whilst on placement. However, you may be able to claim reimbursement of travel costs through The Learner Support Fund provided by the NHS Business Services Authority (NHSBSA).</p>
<p>Students who would like to buy extra uniform items, further to their standard uniform which is included in the course fees, have the option to do so. International experience may incur costs.</p>

                                <h4>An insight into teaching on your course</h4>
                                    <p><strong>Study hours</strong></p>
<p>As a nursing student, you are required to complete 4,600 hours to meet the NMC requirements; 50% of this is theory and 50% is clinical practice. <br><br>Your Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) accounts for 770 hours of theory and 770 practice hours. This represents a third of the required hours. You will complete the remaining hours during the two years of your MSc Nursing programme.</p><p>You will have seven weeks’ holiday a year, and may have to attend sessions outside the normal university hours of 9am to 5pm.</p>                                        <p><strong>Teaching methods</strong></p>
<p>You will be taught by clinically credible staff and those who are research active, along with experienced nurses and health care professionals, who will help you to develop both clinically and intellectually during the programme.</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.015em;"">You will complete a lot of your learning in our newly refurbished and extended Faculty of Health flagship building, Tithebarn Building. Tithebarn is home to our hospital-standard clinical practice suites, modern seminar rooms, lecture theatres and skills labs. </span><br></p><p>The Faculty has a therapeutic suite where you will perform, observe, record and play back a variety of interactive simulations based on a range of teaching methods. </p><p>Your clinical and theoretical experiences will assist you in the development of a range of skills such as communication, decision-making, critical thinking, leadership, case management and team working, all of which are underpinned by the professional values of mental health nursing.</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.015em;"">LJMU’s  £1.6 m clinical practice suites enable you to train on-campus using hospital-standard facilities, including virtual patients. The suites show a patient’s journey from a home environment through to rehabilitation. They cover a range of areas with the latest clinical equipment for simulations and clinical skills development in mental health nursing, adult and child nursing, paramedic practice, social work and midwifery. This environment will help prepare you for the rigours and realism of actual practice, giving you the confidence to deal with real service users in the NHS, private and voluntary settings.</span><br></p><p>You may also have lectures in Marybone, which is just across the street from Tithebarn.</p><p>Blocks of academic study can be up to six weeks depending on what point in the programme you are at. </p><p>You'll participate in seminars, tutorials and lectures, undertaking both group work and individual assignments.</p>                                        <p><strong>Applied learning</strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: -0.24px;"">Work-based learning and c</span><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.015em;"">linical practice is a vital element of this degree and accounts for half of your study time at LJMU. You</span><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.015em;""> will undertake supervised and supported clinical practice and experience the full 24-hour shift working pattern.</span><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.015em;""><br></span></p><p><br>During your clinical practice placements, you will work 30 hours a week and will have a weekly study day of 7.5 hours.<br><br>Whilst on placement, you will work alongside experienced nurses and registered healthcare professionals and be supervised by practice assessors and supervisors, as well as having the support of academic link lecturers. </p><p>Additional support is always available within the Faculty or from student support workers if you need it. All new students coming in to the faculty will have a student mentor allocated to them. Student Mentors are second and third year students who have been selected and trained to mentor new students in all aspects of university life. The student mentor service offers an exciting opportunity for personal and professional development.</p>                        </div>

<p><strong>Our students say: </strong></p>
<p><em>“The biggest challenge I’ve faced since coming to university has been raising a family, doing part-time work whilst being on placement or in university and writing assignments but the support network here is amazing and the challenges have been great. The level of support I have received from both academics and my peers has been amazing and having a guaranteed study day each week really helped me.” </em></p>
<p>- Josh Gilroy, final year BSc (Hons) Mental Health Nursing student (pictured above)</p>
<p>The lecturing staff at Liverpool John Moores University are highly regarded. Students will be taught by clinically credible staff and those who are research active. You will be taught by experienced nurses and health care professionals, who will help you do develop both clinically and intellectually during the programme.<br>
</p>
<p>Mental health nurses deal with a range of mental health problems. They work in a variety of settings ranging from hospitals and high security services to drug and alcohol services and community mental health services for people of all ages. </p>
<p>Your key role and challenge as a mental health nurse will be to engage in, develop and disengage from therapeutic relationships with service users and their families through the use of effective communication and interpersonal skills. Your aim will be to promote health and wellbeing for individuals, along with assisting them to achieve their full potential in recovery. </p><p>Underpinning all aspects of the training offered is a commitment to ethical and anti-oppressive values, values and principles of the NHS Constitution and Professional Body requirements.<br></p>                        </div>

                                <p></p><p>To cater for the wide-ranging content of our courses and the varied learning preferences of our students, we offer a range of assessment methods on each programme. Assessment techniques vary from module to module to reflect relevant assessment approaches and the key learning points of each topic.</p>
<p>Assessment is through a combination of practice placements, exams, essays and assignments and presentations.</p>
<p>There will also be clinical assessment, which will be undertaken whilst in clinical practice where you will be assessed by practice supervisors and assessors. </p>
<p>You will be offered feedback at various points during the course and support will always be readily available from your individual module tutors should you need advice or guidance at any time. We believe that constructive feedback is vital in helping you identify your strengths as well as the areas where you may need to put in more work. </p>                        </div>

                        <p>The paramedic profession is taking ownership in leading the evolving roles for paramedics, delivered with an inter-professional approach. <br>
<br>
Members of the paramedic profession are now more actively involved in undertaking research, leading service reviews and evaluating delivery implementation, as well as evidencing the profession’s contributions to new models of care. <br>

                        <p>The primary care environment is an obvious choice for this to occur. Paramedics must work with patients, primary care clinical staff, academics, commissioners and policymakers to define and shape these integrated roles. An immediate need is to identify the key measures and indicators around quality of communication, clinical excellence and integration into primary care. <br>
<br>
As the role of the paramedic evolves, learning together and working alongside our medical colleagues will be paramount to the safety and success of paramedics as we enter this environment. The MSc Paramedicine programme of study at Liverpool John Moores University will enable the forward thinking clinician to be able to play a major role in the future of paramedic practice, within the context of the wider NHS.</p>

<p>History students at LJMU get involved in a wide range of activities over and above their studies to broaden their skills, knowledge and love of their subject. To help commemorate the 75th anniversary of the the end of the Second World War, representatives of the History department worked with National Trust Formby and Drama at LJMU to create a walking tour around the sand dunes and Formby Point. The dramatisation told the story of the hundreds of children who were evacuated to places like Formby during the Blitz. </p><div class=""m-embed-container"" style=""position: relative;""><img src=""/_common/img/youtube-16x9.png"" style=""display: block !important; width: 100% !important; height: auto !important;"" alt=""Placeholder""><iframe src=""//www.youtube.com/embed/REpJedf6W_g"" style=""width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0;"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""""></iframe></div>*

<p>Within the History department you will work alongside other postgraduate students and academics. In addition, external experts from a range of museum and heritage fields will explore how history is used by museums, heritage centres, charities, political parties among others. We are both committed scholars and dedicated teachers and are proud of fostering a supportive and intellectually stimulating environment for all our students.</p>                                        <p><strong>Applied learning</strong></p>
<p>Over the course of this MA, students will master skills of research, analysis, argument and writing. The course reflects the team’s varied and wide-ranging interests, notably focussed on the modern era from the nineteenth-century to more contemporary times facilitating a range of study, often in new and innovative fields. Our modules cross national borders and historical approaches, encountering a rich array of primary source materials from newspapers and magazines, film, the ephemeral, through to statistics and propaganda.</p>                        </div>

                        <p>LJMU has an excellent employability record with 96% <span style=""font-size: small;"">(HESA 2017)</span> of our postgraduates in work or further study six months after graduation. Our applied learning techniques and strong industry connections ensure our students are fully prepared for the workplace on graduation and understand how to apply their knowledge in a real world context.</p>


                        <p>After graduating with your Masters, you may choose to use your enhanced skill set to move up the career ladder, or to pursue a new direction or specialism. For many nurses, being able to implement their learning in practice is the key driver and reward.</p><p><span style=""font-family: helvetica-light, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 700;"">As a degree profession, nursing sees the added value that research, learning and academic study can have on the patient journey, quality of care, and, of course, your personal and professional development. Key to this is lifelong learning, which is supported by the Nursing and Midwifery Council through revalidation. </span><br></p>

    <strong>Level 4: Integrated Foundations of Pharmacy</strong>
  </p>
  <p>During semester 1, your studies will focus on the scientific foundation of pharmacy, while incorporating aspects of practice where possible, and includes topics such as: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>cells and biomacromolecules</li>
    <li>linking structure to properties and activity</li>
    <li>making drugs into medicines and interactions with the body</li>
  </ul>
  <p>During semester 2, the knowledge and skills developed and established in semester 1 are revisited and applied to specific topics, namely: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>gastrointestinal physiology and pathophysiology</li>
    <li>pain and the peripheral nervous system</li>
    <li>blood</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Concurrently, the professional development strand will introduce and develop fundamental graduate skills, techniques and attributes including laboratory, clinical, communication, learning and study skills. </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Level 5: Medicines, Patients and the Pharmacist </strong>
  </p>
  <p>Your studies will build upon the foundations of the previous year and continues the development of integrated multidisciplinary learning. You will learn the principles of developing quality medicines through the processes of formulation and manufacture, and the application of science and practice to ensure patient safety. This new knowledge and skills will then be revisited and contextualised into specific topics with the pathophysiology, therapeutics, and prevention of diseases focused on at this level.</p><p>Topics include the cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous systems along with infectious disease processes in the body and the population, their responsible pharmaceutical treatment and conservation of the valuable antimicrobial resource. You will also learn the necessary skills and knowledge of how pharmacists can meet the distinct needs of particular patient groups which is undertaken in the cycle of life topic.​</p><p><strong>Sandwich degree​</strong><br></p><ul><li>Year-long work placement</li></ul>

  </p><p><strong>Level 6: Complexities of Healthcare</strong></p>
  <p>During this year, you will take the single modality learning of disease and illness from previous levels and transfer this to multi-morbidity long-term conditions, whose treatment relates to wider health and social care provision.</p>
  <p>As in previous levels, new knowledge will be incorporated into your existing knowledge, augmenting your development of a representative integrative perspective of the programme.</p>
  <p>For example, the concepts of formulation, drug monitoring, medicines optimisation, adverse drug reactions and toxicity will initially be delivered in the context of topics introduced in previous years, such as cardiovascular and respiratory systems. These concepts will then be applied to the endocrine system, mental health, musculoskeletal disorders, and oncology topics. The balance between evidence-based medicine and personalised treatment will be further explored both at the level of the individual’s health and that of the public.</p>
  <p>Professional development will be firmly embedded into your learning with increasingly complex clinical skills being immersed in the range of multi-morbidity long-term conditions. You will continue to progress the development of your research skills with a series of research seminars, including understanding of research philosophy, the underlying tenets of the relevant scientific and social science methodologies inherent in pharmacy.</p>
  <p><strong>Level 7: Advancing Patient-centred Care</strong></p>
  <p>Your final year focuses on utilising highly complex patient-centred and population-based scenarios to ensure you are able to respond appropriately to the complicated concepts and challenging problems inherent in delivering quality healthcare.</p>
  <p>You will consider how health policy impacts on the provision of health and social care services for both individuals and the public. The transition of patient care between care settings (for example, from hospital to community care) will be explored, with a focus on the pharmacists’ role in improving patient outcomes and minimising the disruption to good care during and around the period of transfer, and beyond.</p>
  <p>Specialist areas of practice will be covered in multi-disciplinary sessions (Masterclasses) delivered by expert speakers that will provide you with an understanding of the highly complex nature of health care and the impact of the pharmacist’s role on patients’ health and social wellbeing.</p>
  <p>The professional development strand will involve more challenging consultation scenarios and calculations, and further develop formative leadership and management skills. Building upon the research from the previous year, you will utilise and apply your independent-research and critical analysis skills to an extended research project.</p>

                    <ul>
    <li>Study at the Liverpool Centre for Advanced Policing Studies (LCAPS) which is licensed by the College of Policing to deliver Police Education Qualifications Framework (PEQF) programmes</li>
    <li>Embark on a programme designed as a higher qualification for those in supervisory, management and leadership roles</li>
    <li>Reflect on your individual and team approaches to leadership in an increasingly complex environment</li>
    <li>Learn from active researchers, former and serving officers, and subject specialists </li>
    <li>Participate in a variety of masterclasses throughout the academic year delivered by experts. Previous speakers include: the Director of Public Prosecutions and a former UN peacekeeper</li>
</ul>
<pthe>
<p>During your studies, you will discuss and debate the major issues facing organisations, such as austerity and the changing nature of demand. You will be supported to reflect on your individual and team approaches to leadership and will explore the role of policing and law enforcement agencies in the wider context of society.</p>
<p>Since its creation in 2015, LCAPS has developed well-established relationships with a number of police and law enforcement agencies, particularly Merseyside Police, so we are well placed to attract serving officers and staff to study at LJMU.</p>

<p>During the development of this programme, we have been working with our partners to develop opportunities for students to gain practical law enforcement experience during their studies, which could include short placements in a number of agencies. Similarly, there may be opportunities to send students to study for short periods of time in academic institutions abroad, as part of the university’s Go Global programme. Any opportunities will be discussed with interested students as and when they are available.</p>
<p>Teaching in the Centre for Advanced Policing Studies aims to combine academic rigour with critical attention to policy and practice agendas; proactively supporting workforce development, collaborating with policy makers and practitioners to provide a world-leading, cutting-edge, interdisciplinary teaching portfolio. LCAPS tutors include a mixture of academics and former practitioners from various disciplines including law, intelligence and policing, with former officers from ranging from Constable to Chief Constable. The Centre delivers a range of degrees covering a gamut of learning requirements and including experiential masters, distance learning and career partnership CPDs.</p>

                        <p>The College of Policing is the Professional Statutory and Regulatory Body (PSRB) for policing. The College has mandated that from 2020 there will be three entry routes into policing at Constable level. There is ongoing consultation between the College and the policing sector regarding the implications of the PEQF for those in supervisory, management and leadership roles. This MSc reflects all the current advice and guidance issued by the College, policing and other Law Enforcement agencies.</p>

                        <h4>Further your career prospects</h4>
                        <p>LJMU has an excellent employability record with 96% <span style=""font-size: small;"">(HESA 2017)</span> of our postgraduates in work or further study six months after graduation. Our applied learning techniques and strong industry connections ensure our students are fully prepared for the workplace on graduation and understand how to apply their knowledge in a real world context.</p>


                        <p>The ‘Professionalisation’ agenda being promoted by the College of Policing has been agreed and formalised in terms of the three new entry routes at Police Constable level (the Pre-Join Policing Degree, the Police Constable Degree Apprenticeship – PCDA – and the Degree Holder Entry Programme – DHEP). Consultation is still ongoing with the police service to agree the implications for more senior ranks. The likelihood is that Sergeants will require a Graduate Certificate and Inspectors/Chief Inspectors a PG Certificate in Policing Studies.</p>

                        <p>For Superintendent ranks it is likely that a PG Diploma will be required, with a Masters degree being the default position for anyone wanting to attend the Strategic Command Course, with a view to becoming a Chief Officer.  Recent trends have shown a majority of ambitious police and law enforcement leadership agency staff (in anticipation of, and to get ahead of, the forthcoming PEQF reforms for senior leaders) looking to obtain a Masters degree at Inspector level and above.</p>

<p>Teaching on postgraduate taught programmes is a combination of core and option modules, with lecture and seminar commitments throughout the week. Once timetables have been confirmed for the programme this information will be updated.</p>
<p>As with all postgraduate courses, you will be expected to be a self-sufficient learner who uses available resources to complete written assignments.</p>                                        <p><strong>Teaching methods</strong></p>
<p>Teaching will be delivered through lectures and seminars with visits from relevant guest speakers combined with interactive workshops and IT sessions. Teaching will also be supported by tutorial drop-in sessions.</p>                                        <p><strong>Applied learning</strong></p>
<p>Each student at the Centre for Advanced Policing Studies, regardless of level of study, is encouraged to attend the regular Masterclasses we organise with leading practitioners covering a range of topics pertinent to key areas of study. Previous speakers have included Alison Saunders, the former Director of Public Prosecutions; Deborah Gould, Barrister and Principal Crown Advocate for the West Midlands CPS, and Mr. Andre Rebello OBE, Senior Coroner for the Liverpool and Wirral.</p>                        </div>

                                <h4>How learning is monitored on your programme</h4>
                                <p></p><p>To cater for the wide-ranging content of our courses and the varied learning preferences of our students, we offer a range of assessment methods on each programme. Assessment techniques vary from module to module to reflect relevant assessment approaches and the key learning points of each topic.</p>
<p>Final examination for both the MPhil and the PhD is by thesis and oral examination. <br>
</p>
<p>The MPhil differs from the PhD in terms of the depth of study required and the extent of your personal contribution to knowledge. It requires competence in conducting an independent enquiry as well as in the use of appropriate research methods and techniques. Examiners will expect you to display satisfactory background knowledge of the subject. <br>
</p>
<p>To gain a PhD you are expected to show mastery of a special field and to have made an original personal contribution to the understanding of a problem, the advancement of knowledge, or the generation of new ideas. Examiners will expect you to be at the forefront of understanding in your chosen topic. <br>
</p>
<p>If you are studying for an MPhil you may be able to progress to a PhD, via written and oral assessments in Year 2 (for full-time students) or Year 3 (for part-time students).</p>                        </div>

                        <h4>Further your career prospects</h4>
                        <p>LJMU has an excellent employability record with 96% <span style=""font-size: small;"">(HESA 2017)</span> of our postgraduates in work or further study six months after graduation. Our applied learning techniques and strong industry connections ensure our students are fully prepared for the workplace on graduation and understand how to apply their knowledge in a real world context.</p>


                        <p>Studying for a postgraduate research degree enhances your employability in a number of ways. </p>
<p>As well as enabling you to focus on your specific areas of interest and expand your subject knowledge ready for employment in your chosen sector, a postgraduate research qualification enables you to take charge of your career path by demonstrating your contribution to an area of knowledge. It enhances your self-confidence and showcases your ability to work independently and ‘go it alone’.<br>
<br>
According to a report by the <a href=""https://www.hesa.ac.uk/"">Higher Education Statistics Agency</a> (HESA), more than a quarter of graduates felt that their employment prospects were increased by their PG qualification. And when it comes to earnings, those with a postgrad qualification have been shown to earn an average of 24% more than those who leave education with an undergraduate degree.</p>

                                <p></p><p>To cater for the wide-ranging content of our courses and the varied learning preferences of our students, we offer a range of assessment methods on each programme. Assessment techniques vary from module to module to reflect relevant assessment approaches and the key learning points of each topic.</p>
<p>Final examination for both the MPhil and the PhD is by thesis and oral examination. <br>
</p>
<p>The MPhil differs from the PhD in terms of the depth of study required and the extent of your personal contribution to knowledge. It requires competence in conducting an independent enquiry as well as in the use of appropriate research methods and techniques. Examiners will expect you to display satisfactory background knowledge of the subject. <br>
</p>
<p>To gain a PhD you are expected to show mastery of a special field and to have made an original personal contribution to the understanding of a problem, the advancement of knowledge, or the generation of new ideas. Examiners will expect you to be at the forefront of understanding in your chosen topic. <br>
</p>
<p>If you are studying for an MPhil you may be able to progress to a PhD, via written and oral assessments in Year 2 (for full time students) or Year 3 (for part time students). </p>                        </div>

                                            <h4>Discover the building blocks of your course</h4>
<p>Your programme is made up of a number of core modules as detailed below.</p>
<p>The Professional Doctorate in Sport and Exercise Psychology is available in various durations to suit your circumstances. The minimum is a statutory 2 years as a full-time student. The equivalent part-time programme is 4 years long.  In addition, we also offer a full-time programme that is 3 years duration, and a part-time version that lasts up to 6 years. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>All programme variants have the same essential structure, with the same taught sessions that occur primarily in the first year. The programme duration you choose is largely dictated by your work placement(s) and other work related opportunities you may secure. For example, if you are working on doctorate related activity full-time then it is likely you will opt for a full-time programme duration. If you are working half-time or more, but less than full-time, then you must opt for a part-time version. Anything less than half time is not suitable for doctorate completion.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The number of years you chose to study for will mainly be dictated by how busy you find yourself and how much spare time you have for the additional paperwork that the doctorate necessitates.  For some, a two-year full-time programme is very packed and proves difficult, and the third year programme suits them better. The programme team at LJMU are happy to discuss your needs and what might suit you best depending on your personal circumstances; no two applicants are alike. It is also possible to change your study mode e.g. from full to part–time according to your circumstances.</p><p>This course is currently undergoing a review which may impact the advertised modules. Any changes will be communicated to interested parties to ensure they wish to proceed with their application.<br></p>                                </div>

                                    <p><strong>Study hours</strong></p>
<p>All teaching is on Thursdays 10am-12pm and 2pm-4pm, leaving you some time in the day to meet with your supervisor. Sessions are formally scheduled from January to June and September to December in year one and on an ad hoc basis in subsequent years.</p>                                        <p><strong>Teaching methods</strong></p>
<p>You will develop your skills in teaching and training (education and dissemination), research, consultancy and the generic professional skills needed to qualify as a Sport and Exercise Psychologist. This is achieved through your own work-based learning experiences, taught sessions on the programme and extensive supervision.</p>                        </div>
                    </div>,<div class=""l-col-6 l-padinfull"" data-mh=""course-overview"">

<p>To be offered a place on the programme, you need to have secured your own placement, or work related opportunities (or a combination of the two) to satisfy the hours of client contact required. Once on the programme, you are likely to encounter other opportunities, sourced by you or our staff (who have extensive networks with numerous sport and exercise organisations) that you may choose to undertake as further support for your training.</p>                        </div>

Assessment techniques vary from module to module to reflect relevant assessment approaches and the key learning points of each topic.</p>
<p>The Professional Doctorate in Sport and Exercise Psychology programme requires a portfolio of work to be completed. This includes: a log and reflective diary of professional practice and consultancy/teaching plus training case studies. In terms of research, you will be expected to produce a systematic literature review and two empirical papers of publishable quality.</p>                        </div>

<p>The Rice-Jones Scholarship will be offered to applicants who have accepted a place to study on a postgraduate law course including, but not limited to, the Graduate Diploma in Law, the Legal Practice Course, the Bar Professional Training Course or the Masters in Law.</p>
<p>For all 2021/22 applications, each award will total between £250 and £1500 towards study expenses. Awards granted will depend on the applications received.</p>

                    <p>Technology and the World Wide Web have not only brought societies around the globe closer together, they are both directly and indirectly responsible for creating vulnerabilities. Those vulnerabilities manifest in many different forms that span a spectrum of issues ranging from cybercrime, political and social upheaval, to recruiting would be terrorists. Moreover, as the world has become reliant on technology, the risk to personal and organisational information has also become vulnerable.</p>
<p>Identity theft, corporate espionage, and electronic transactions have all become vulnerable to those that wish to exploit that environment. The Security Management programme is designed to prepare individuals to work in this vocation whether it be in the public or private sectors.</p>

                    <h4>LJMU's school-centric Salaried School Direct programme leads to Qualified Teacher Status at Primary or Secondary level, funds your teacher training and pays a salary.</h4>
                    <ul>
    <li>Earn whilst you learn on this school-centric initial teacher training programme</li>
    <li>Train to teach from within a school setting and be involved in school life from the first day of term</li>
    <li>Follow a curriculum developed and delivered in partnership with outstanding local schools</li>
    <li>Learn from expert teachers</li>
    <li>Prepare for a career as an innovative and creative teacher in an excellent school</li>
</ul>
<p>School Direct is a route into teaching featuring a school-centred approach. As a School Direct (salaried) trainee, you will be employed in a school while you train and will receive a salary from your school (the amount paid is linked to the unqualified teacher pay scale which may be enhanced by schools for some subject areas). The school will also cover the cost of your training to become a qualified teacher.<br>
<br>
This programme is usually open to graduates with three years' work experience post graduation. Schools can, however, choose to accept applications from candidates with less work experience to attract high-quality applicants in hard-to-fill subjects, such as Mathematics and Physics. This route is ideal if you are considering a career change, but you must apply with a school willing to support you and to employ you whilst you train. If you are interested in the Salaried route, please contact the Lead School to discuss your application, before you apply.</p>

                        <p>Trainees on the School Direct (salaried) programme are employed as unqualified teachers during the period of their training. Many schools are seeking to fill a vacant post at the end of the course, though there is no guarantee of employment. </p>
<p>During your training there will be ample opportunities for engagement with relevant local employment organisations including schools and teacher recruitment agencies through on-campus events.</p>
<p>You will be encouraged to join the relevant professional association for your subject or area of study, providing the opportunity to engage with wider networks of teachers and others interested in your chosen area.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Study hours</strong></p>
<p>Although you will spend the majority of your time in school there are university-based training sessions at the IM Marsh campus. These include: a week long summer school at the end of August and some weekly campus sessions. Some sessions may be delivered by and in partner schools. </p>
<p>As this is a postgraduate course, you should expect to undertake a significant amount of independent study and preparation, not only to support your course assignments, but also your school-based work.</p>                                        <p><strong>Teaching methods</strong></p>
<p>School based training involves the preparation and delivery of learning sequences and lessons to small groups and whole classes of learners, with expectations and workload increasing during the course. </p>
<p>The course is delivered through a variety of teaching methods including lectures, seminars, interactive workshops, group discussion and reflection, problem solving and micro-teaching. We also make full use of the University’s Virtual Learning Environment.</p>
<p>There is a real focus on providing you with the skills and knowledge required. Tutorial support is an important part of the process and you will receive a personalised service that will enable you to set targets and achieve to your highest potential. </p>                        </div>

                                    <p><strong>Study hours</strong></p>
<p>Although you will spend the majority of your time in school there are university-based training sessions at the IM Marsh campus. These include: a week long summer school at the end of August and some weekly campus sessions and a number of conference days or full weeks of training. Additional training and professional development programmes are organised in school by the Lead School. Some School Direct programmes are taught by LJMU staff on school premises, instead of at the University. Please contact Lead Schools for further information.</p>
<p>As this is a postgraduate course, you should expect to undertake a significant amount of independent study and preparation, not only to support your course assignments, but also your school-based work.</p>                                        <p><strong>Teaching methods</strong></p>
<p>School based training involves the preparation and delivery of learning sequences and lessons to small groups and whole classes of learners, with expectations and workload increasing during the course. This work is supported by your teacher-mentor who will support your professional learning experience in school. </p>
<p>The course is delivered through a variety of teaching methods including lectures, seminars, interactive workshops, group discussion and reflection, problem solving and micro-teaching. We also make full use of the University’s Virtual Learning Environment.</p>                        </div>

Assessment techniques vary from module to module to reflect relevant assessment approaches and the key learning points of each topic.</p>
<p>A variety of assessment methods are used during the course including: critical reflections on practice, literature review, small scale research projects and design and analysis of learning experiences.</p>
<p>During your training, you will monitor your progression towards achieving Qualified Teachers Status (QTS) and will need to maintain an appropriate professional development portfolio to support this.<br>
<br>
A final assessment will be based on observation of your teaching practice and the evidence base that you develop during training.</p>                        </div>

Staff will also help you grow your network by connecting you with researchers and professional practitioners that they work with. For example, staff on the coaching programme are currently leading an EU-wide project on disability sport coaching, as well as working with a number of sport organisations such as St Helen’s Rugby League, The Football Association, UK Coaching, England Netball and International ParaHockey. Studying in this environment will provide you with the opportunity to improve your analytical, critical reflection and problem-solving skills, as well as enabling you to effectively manage the coaching process.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Study hours</strong></p>
<p>You will have a number of hours per module per week of taught material and/or laboratory work. The majority of teaching will take place on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, however the days/number of hours taught will vary week to week. Private study will cover both time spent studying at home or in the library, analysing data and completing directed tasks and coursework. Taught sessions will provide an orientation to the topic and an opportunity for classroom discussion and debate. You will be expected to read widely using primary sources of reference material.</p>                                        <p><strong>Teaching methods</strong></p>
<p>You will learn through lectures, seminars, workshops, student-led discussion groups, laboratory and overseas fieldwork. Self-guided study is a key requirement at MSc level, so you will need the flexibility to organise your study time outside of contact hours.</p>
<p>You will be encouraged to attend and present your work at national and international conferences, and to publish your research in scientific journals.</p>                        </div>

                                    <p><strong>Study hours</strong></p>
<p>You can study full-time (52 weeks) or part-time (104 weeks), with modules delivered two or three days a week and clinical placements interspersing the classroom learning blocks. Theory days can be used for activities such as non-module specific sessions, masterclasses, personal study and assignment preparation.</p>                                        <p><strong>Teaching methods</strong></p>
<p>At this level, independent study is essential and much of the learning is self-guided. You will be introduced to new concepts through formal lectures and tutorials, whereas workshops will offer you the opportunity for deeper investigation. Many sessions are co-taught with other community nursing programmes, enabling you to get a better understanding and appreciation of other healthcare specialists. </p>
<p>Formal lectures introduce concepts whilst tutorials and workshops offer the opportunity for deeper investigation. You will then be invited to present a paper at a group seminar which will be used as a starting point for peer group debate.

                                <h4>An insight into teaching on your course</h4>
                                    <p><strong>Study hours</strong></p>
<p>The programme timetable comprises 50% theory and 50% practice.</p><p>Modules run on one,  two and, very occasionally, three specified days of the week. This allows the timetable to be predictable, and facilitates the part-time students undertaking the relevant modules with their full-time counterparts. The university day usually runs from 9.30am to 4pm.</p><p>Practice days are in a combination of single days or blocks of days. This combined approach has been developed in response to student and practice teacher feedback. It allows the student to become established in the practice setting, supports continuity of patient/client care, and aims to support students to balance their practice and academic work. The practice day varies by placement area and service, but generally attendance is required 9am-5pm.</p>                                        <p><strong>Teaching methods</strong></p>
<p>An important element of the programme is to recognise and utilise the current skills of the students and to build on these competencies. Students are encouraged to share their knowledge and experiences and to network both within their peer group and externally. The teaching and learning activities will build on student experiences and will facilitate and encourage further development of existing theoretical and professional knowledge.</p><p>The use of interactive lectures and seminars, group work and problem based learning techniques help identify existing skills and, at the same time, encourage students to develop and tailor their portfolio of competencies to meet present and future challenges. </p>                        </div>

<img src=""/~/media/images/ljmu/postgraduate-course-images/default-images/pgteaching.png?h=310&amp;w=510&amp;la=en"" alt=""Image of two people looking at computer monitor""><p>Many of the sessions are shared between the different routes of the community programmes and with other disciplines. Group discussions and workshops provide an ideal opportunity for students to gain knowledge about other specialist roles. </p>
<p><strong>Applied learning</strong></p>
<p>There is a series of placements to enrich your learning and allow you to experience a variety of partner settings. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>You will spend time in a children's hospice, a special school, A&amp;E, a children's walk-in centre and a neo-natal unit. These invaluable placements will enable you to build up a network of contacts and a greater appreciation of where your role a Specialist Community Children's Nurse fits into the overall scheme of healthcare provision.</p>                        </div>

                                <p></p><p>To cater for the wide-ranging content of our courses and the varied learning preferences of our students, we offer a range of assessment methods on each programme. Assessment techniques vary from module to module to reflect relevant assessment approaches and the key learning points of each topic.</p>
<p>To gain the credits required for each module you must be able to demonstrate that you have achieved all of the learning outcomes for that module and completed the Practice Evidence Tool.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Formal grading, which counts towards your final module results, involves essays, seminar presentations, reflective diaries, reports and essays, exams and clinical skill observations. You will also receive feedback on your progress throughout the course. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Theory assessments are awarded pass, refer or fail and practice assessments are classed as competent or not competent in each specific area.</p>                        </div>

<p>Helen Mayo is Assistant Media Manager at Everton Football Club.<br>
<br>
Speaking about her role at Everton, Helen said:<br>
<br>
“I’m responsible for proactively arranging interviews for men’s and women’s teams to enhance the reputation of individuals and the club. We also arrange player appearances, deal with incoming media enquiries and requests, ensure the club complies with media rules set out by the Premier League and maintain strong relationships with external media partners, such as Sky Sports. Every day is different with new challenges. I’m proud to work for Everton.”<br>
<br>
Helen reflected on her studies at LJMU: <br>
<br>
“It’s not just about the academic skills of writing, shorthand and understanding media law, but the skills you need in a workplace such as working as a team, learning from others, being confident enough to share your opinions and so on. Never forget that you can learn something from everyone you meet. Enjoy talking to people and be inquisitive.”</p>

                        <h2>Employability</h2>
                        <h4>Further your career prospects</h4>
                        <p>LJMU has an excellent employability record with 96% <span style=""font-size: small;"">(HESA 2017)</span> of our postgraduates in work or further study six months after graduation. Our applied learning techniques and strong industry connections ensure our students are fully prepared for the workplace on graduation and understand how to apply their knowledge in a real world context.</p>


                        <p>The integrated and critical nature of the programme promotes qualities and skills relevant to employability within the sports nutrition field. The degree is ideal for individuals looking to work as Sports Nutritionists with national governing bodies such as the English Institute of Sport (EIS).</p>
<p>Many graduates from this programme have gone on to work as Sport Nutritionists in professional sports clubs and/or national Institutes of sport including Manchester United FC, Warrington Wolves, The RFU, The EIS and Team Sky. Some have gone on to further studies, e.g. a PhD in Sport Nutrition or Exercise Metabolism. Graduates also work as self-employed Sport Nutritionists for professional and amateur athletes.</p>
<p>Although most graduates pursue accreditation with SENr and seek work in the field of sport nutrition, the degree is also ideally suited for Strength and Conditioning Practitioners who are looking to increase their knowledge and applied skills in nutrition, as well as those interested in using exercise nutrition to improve the health of the general public. The theoretical basis of the course will also be ideal if you wish to pursue further academic studies and move to a PhD in nutrition or exercise biochemistry. The translational skills taught on the course are applicable to working in the community and improving the health and fitness of the general population. The main focus of the programme, however, is on working with elite performers and investigating how nutrition can maximise the health, body composition and performance of athletes.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Study hours</strong></p>
<p>Students will have approximately two to three hours per module per week of taught material and/or seminar work in semester 1 (September to December) and semester 2 (January to April). This may be supplemented by reflective tutorials. Private study will cover both time spent studying (e.g. in the library), collecting data in the laboratory and completing directed tasks and coursework. Taught sessions will provide an orientation to the topic and opportunity for classroom discussion and debate. You will also be expected to read widely using primary sources of reference material. The applied placement in semester 3 (May to August) will require the student to spend a minimum of 130 hours with the placement provider, which will be supplemented by hours spent preparing for placement duties, private study and tutorials/meetings with the placement provider and placement tutor.</p>                                        <p><strong>Teaching methods</strong></p>
<p>Teaching will take place in small groups, using the world-class facilities in LJMU’s award-winning Tom Reilly and Life Sciences Buildings and the newly refurbished, high performance gym. It will have a strong research focus to help you become a critical scientific thinker, empowering you to challenge existing paradigms and be a better practitioner. You will be taught by academics who work with a range of elite organisations, including renowned strength and conditioning practioner <a href=""https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/about-us/news/features/strength-and-conditioning"">Dave Clark</a>.</p>                        </div>

                                    <p><strong>Study hours</strong></p>
<p>There are five residential weekends at St Vincent's across the two years. Students are also expected to carry out 170-190 hours of independent study per module. </p>                                        <p><strong>Teaching methods</strong></p>
<p>A blended learning model forms the basis of study for this programme. This includes distance learning via an online learning platform, where students will have access to study materials. Learning is also supported by attendance at five residential weekends delivered at St. Vincent’s School in Liverpool. The residential weekends provide face-to-face teaching, networking and the provision for tutorial support including braille clinics. Each student is allocated their personal braille tutor for the duration of the course. </p><p>Guest speakers and other professionals from a range of related disciplines also lecture in their field of expertise at these weekends. The time at St Vincent’s also provides students with a hands on practical approach in gathering information from this centre of excellence to ensure the competent delivery in the education of the visually impaired learner. The weekends offer extended opportunities for research and collaborative working with fellow students and other professionals. On site accommodation and catering is provided for students for the duration of the residential weekends.</p>                        </div>

<p>The degree also is accredited by the JBM but as a ‘non-technical’ MSc. It therefore could provide the educational base for CEng but only with a JBM accredited Engineering undergraduate degree.</p>
