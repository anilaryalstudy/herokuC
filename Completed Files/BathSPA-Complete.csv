"Contemporary Circus with Physical Theatre, FdA",,,"https://www.bathspa.ac.uk/courses/fd-contemporary-circus-with-physical-theatre/",,,,"Foundation degree ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<div class=""collapsible-content-text""><p>This course aims to develop you as a well rounded circus-theatre artist who can be both creator and performer. It's an intensive and highly practical course with an emphasis on breadth rather than narrow skill acquisition. The first term begins with an introduction to the practical circus disciplines of aerial, acrobalance and object manipulation. Later in the year, students specialise further within these areas, alongside continuing classes in physical theatre, movement, fitness and conditioning, critical thinking and contextual studies.</p>
<p>Emphasis moves increasingly towards creative application as you plan spring and summer projects shown to an invited audience and a final ensemble production at the end of the year. Other performance opportunities include a group Christmas show and street theatre performances at various events around the UK.</p>
<p>During the second year you broaden your understanding of performance styles and techniques such as burlesque, clowning, stand-up comedy and live art. Essential employability skills are developed as you learn how to produce a business plan and create a showreel and portfolio. You'll receive training in how to teach circus to others and plan and deliver an actual lesson. The year culminates with the Ensembles project; a group devised work of significant length performed to a public audience.</p>

You'll receive up to four discipline classes per week.</p>
<p><strong>Physical theatre, movement, voice and creative studies</strong><br>This core component allows you to explore how to reinterpret work through different mediums for a range of audiences.</p>
<p><strong>Fitness and conditioning</strong> <br>An important aspect of the course is ensuring you know how to look after yourself. You’ll learn practical techniques to look after your body, and learn about nutrition to keep yourself in peak condition.</p>
<p><strong>Complementary studies including practical, technical and academic theory</strong><br>Understanding all the technical and practical aspects of performance helps you when creating work. You’ll explore the history of circus, and develop your academic skills through written research projects.</p>
<p><strong>Practice and evaluations</strong><br>Throughout the course you'll regularly show work to gain feedback from peers and tutors and help evaluate and feedback on others’ work. This is vital for creators and performers in developing work and allows you to begin doing so in a safe and comfortable environment. </p></div>",

<p>These fundamental skills will include drawing, image making crafts, computer graphics, stop-frame animation, coding, 3D modelling, 2D motion graphics and compositing.</p>
<p>You will test these skills through a variety of modern applications such as outdoor projection, virtual reality, augmented reality, film, TV, online video, computer games, the web and mobile apps.</p>
<p>The combination of these technical skills with research into the contexts, history and theory of animation and narrative practice will ensure both practical ability and critical literacy in our Digital Animation graduates.</p></div>","<div class=""collapsible-content-text""><div>
<div><strong>Year one</strong></div>
<div>You'll practise visual research methods and animation fundamentals, including sketchbooks, storyboards, flipbooks, video and photography.

All modules will include research methods to ensure contextualisation and historical knowledge.</div>

</div>
<div><strong>Year two</strong></div>
<div>In the second year, your technical and conceptual knowledge is expanded with more complicated production methods and the introduction of modern-day contexts and techniques (such as outdoor projection mapping and virtual reality). These will give you the opportunity to experience your work in these formats and learn about the challenges that each presents. You will deepen your knowledge of coding through interactivity, explore character animation, and consider narrative and story on a deeper level.<br>

<div><strong>Year three</strong></div>
<div>In your final year, you'll take a more self-directed approach as you decide on your specialist areas of practice, or to remain broad. You'll explore industry-based projects as appropriate for an Art or a Design context (and understand the difference). You will be encouraged to seek collaboration opportunities, and explore the future directions of animation via a dissertation. Finally, a major project will allow you to create a larger piece of work (or a portfolio of smaller projects), all forming part of a cohesive animation showreel demonstrating your depth of skill, knowledge and innovation.</div>

We prioritise the ‘complete picture’ to give you the insight and toolkit needed to make effective operation decisions that protect organisations at risk of cyber attack.</p>
<p>You begin by building knowledge of the fundamentals of cyber security before examining existing and emerging defence and offense strategies. Equipped with a good understanding of vulnerabilities and attack vectors, you then explore how to build an active cyber defence armoury. Modules on law and regulation, systems of governance, operational resilience and risk assessment provide the conceptual context needed to engage the practical realities of cyber security management.</p></div>","<div class=""collapsible-content-text""><p><strong>Cyber Security Bootcamp</strong> offers a holistic perspective of cyber security. You’ll learn about threat detection and prevention strategies, risk management, investigative tools, and the way in which each are leveraged by organisations to secure operations and minimise disruption.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Vulnerability Analysis</strong> exposes specific strategies for evaluating and reporting, for example, structural vulnerabilities and inadequate cybersecurity safeguards. Business preparations that include a degree of penetration testing are examined.</p>
<p><strong>Business Security Architecture</strong> aims to develop your understanding of how to define an appropriate security architecture for a business. You also learn about established architectures, trade-offs between security and business functionality, and strategies of information governance.</p>
<p><strong>Offensive and Defensive Cyber Operations</strong> aims to provide you with an in-depth understanding of the techniques used in computer and network defence. As cyber defenders you learn about the strategies and technical skills to protect and harden cyber systems such as collecting appropriate data through logging, detecting persistent hacking attempts, and responding to intrusions.</p>
<p><strong>Critical National Infrastructure (CNI)</strong> is about learning to define the relevant CNI for your country and analyse its potential impact on a chosen business or sector. You explore the unique operational resilience challenges and the emerging industry and government standards for that sector. Protecting CNI is of developing concern that is rising up the national risk registers internationally. An understanding of this topic is therefore a key part of a cyber security professionals knowledge base.</p>
<p><strong>Cyber War</strong> is about who the threat actors currently are, and who they may be in the near future. It examines how attackers identify targets of opportunity and how they work to disrupt them. Across the module you analyse case studies of past cyberwars with a view to understanding their motivations, attack strategies and impacts.</p>
<p><strong>Dissertation</strong>: taking into account relevant theories, practice and organisational contexts, you first identify a target for enquiry in agreement with your supervisor. Following approval of your plan, you proceed to conduct the research, evaluate data, and articulate findings and recommendations in the form of an academic report. The final stage of your dissertation is a viva in which you defend your arguments.</p></div>","<div class=""collapsible-content-text""><p>For graduates of Computing disciplines, MSc Cyber Security supports entry into a range of IT roles where cyber security is an integral component but not necessarily an entire responsibility. You’ll be able to demonstrate your value to a range of companies quickly, and later build on the management skills gained during your study to compete for more senior positions.</p>
<p>For those already employed in the IT field, this Cyber Security Master's provides opportunities for professional upskilling. The programme helps improve your prospects of transitioning to cyber security roles and decision-making positions. The knowledge you gain on the course will in addition help you increase your profile within your company, while benefiting the teams you work within.</p>

You begin by learning about all the roles that a circus director may be required to fulfil, including dramaturgy, choreography and design, as well as the implications of different starting points such as performer-as-source and director-as-author. You engage in short, small projects, mainly working to facilitate the creative ideas and performance of the performer(s).</p>
<p><strong>Professional Collaboration</strong><br>This module gives you the opportunity to explore your subject specialism within a contemporary professional context to promote entrepreneurialism and/or professional practice. The shared elements of this module links Performing Arts practitioners from different subject areas, while subject specific content focuses on professional approaches. This module includes placements with leading UK contemporary circus companies.</p>
<p><strong>Circus Directing Two: Director as Author</strong><br>This module develops your directing skills with a longer, more in-depth project, with more emphasis on director-as-author, shifting the emphasis from taught learning to more independent learning. You direct circus-based acts or pieces to demonstrate your advanced level skills through practice, at a semi-professional level. You’ll also reflect critically upon your overall skills development for directing circus and place them in the context of the contemporary industry. Teaching includes workshops, seminars, and off-site visits to companies in rehearsal.</p>
<p><strong>Major Project</strong><br>Your final project will draw on skills and knowledge acquired in modules one, two, three and four. Drawing on an area of practice that is central to your interests and aspirations, your thesis content is decided in negotiation with your course tutors. It may take the form of a written submission or practical work or a combination of both. The initial stages of your project will commence with tutor guidance and then become self-directed in its later stages. A single summative assessment will conclude this final module of your Master’s degree.</p></div>",

<p>There are three main components to the course, all of which run in parallel: Identity, Industry, and Context.</p>
<p><strong>Identity</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The initial stages of the course encompass a broad knowledge and understanding of photography, fashion, design, collaboration and context, essential for any aspiring Fashion Photographer. We'll focus on your personal growth as a practitioner and help you identify your professional aspirations for employment/self-employment.</p>
<p>We place an emphasis on developing and advancing your practical skills and technical knowledge through an increasingly self-initiated, experimental and innovative programme of independent study.</p>
<p><strong>Industry </strong></p>
<p>The course is designed to ensure that you, as a graduate, can apply your knowledge and skills with innovation and integrity in a professional context. Through placement and industry-facing projects, you'll obtain a comprehensive understanding of the changing demands facing the Fashion and Photography industries.</p>
<p>Throughout all levels of your study you'll engage with industry partners, advance your skills in marketing and networking, become increasingly proficient in presentation, promotion and project management.</p>
<p><strong>Context </strong></p>
<p>We place focus on how the development of your increasingly sophisticated photographic portfolio is both critically and contextually understood. You'll engage with an in-depth theoretical study of still and moving imagery and the complex roles they both play within historical and contemporary society.</p>
<p>An emphasis is placed on the sustainable and ethical responsibilities you have as a globally conscious practitioner.</p></div>","<div class=""collapsible-content-text""><p><strong>Year One</strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The course starts with an Introduction to Photography skills development. You'll gain an understanding of the principles of interpreting images, and the role a camera can play in establishing identity. You'll explore digital image production alongside analogue practices in our excellent Photography workshops and will be exposed to the variables at play when photographing on location and shooting within the studio. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Embedded within the development of technical skills is a grounding of photographic and fashion movements in a global context. This critical context for your study is established through an Introduction to Visual and Material Culture, Ideology, conceptual, historical, ethical and technical aspects of photographic and fashion practices. You'll explore the impact a fashion image can have in various digital or print forms by analysing the interpretation of images within different contexts. <br><br></span><strong>Year Two</strong></p>
<p>You'll take part in independently-led research projects with a greater focus on industry collaboration. The course will require you to participate in lectures and seminars that are designed to establish the theoretical grounds in which your developing practice is located.</p>
<p>Alongside developing technical and image production skills to industry standard, you will begin to galvanise an understanding of the role your own practice plays within the world and within the fashion fraternity more specifically. <br><br><strong>Year Three</strong></p>
<p>Your final year of study requires you to bring together the advancement of your technical and cognitive skills, alongside your gained experience of industry practices into a comprehensive portfolio of photographic work. This independent and innovative body of work will evidence self-initiated problem solving, an in-depth knowledge and understanding of your contemporary and critical awareness and will require you to regularly reassess your practice within cultural and social contexts verbally, practically and in written form.</p>
<p>Your study will end with a major professional project in the form of an exhibition.</p></div>","<div class=""collapsible-content-text""><p>The breadth of the course will equip graduates with the skills to pursue portfolio careers. You will gain experience to thrive in a shifting and fluid context – whether working for employers or as freelancers.</p></div>"

<p>Alongside an introductory module that will involve practical work on research techniques and theories, you'll work closely with tutors on three modules – ‘Emergencies’, ‘Intersections’, and ‘Materialities’.</p></div>","<div class=""collapsible-content-text""><p><strong>Research: methods, resources, dissemination</strong> <br>This module will refresh and further develop your research and writing skills, and introduce significant theories and approaches. We'll also use this as a space in which to develop a supportive scholarly community, helping you to make the transition into postgraduate study.</p>
<p><strong>Intersections: rewriting gender</strong><br>This module addresses a long and dynamic counter-tradition that questions the categories assigned to us as gendered subjects. It focuses on texts – literary and otherwise – that recognise the reductiveness of fixed, binary structures in art as in life.</p>
<p><strong>Emergencies: literature in a time of crisis</strong><br>This module begins from the observation that history is comprised of ‘emergencies’. This involves you in debates over, for example, place, globality, and environmentalism; equality, democracy and diversity. It aims to spark imaginative and critical connections between literature, art, philosophy, and politics.</p>
<p><strong>Materialities: the past and futures of the book</strong><br>This module explores the book – ‘the most powerful object of our time’ – as both a capacious idea and a fluid, material form. Each form – whether digital, printed, serialised, an app, or as art – has its own history, and each form fundamentally changes the questions we can ask of the words embodied therein.</p>
<p><strong>Dissertation / Project</strong><br>This module allows you to pursue an area of study of your own choice to a high level. You can opt for a dissertation, or design a Project of equivalent weight. The Project offers you the opportunity to find a form that can give your work enhanced impact in the world beyond university.</p></div>","<div class=""collapsible-content-text""><p>This course has been designed to enable you to become confident in analysing complex problems, in exploring and formulating practical solutions, and in developing effective and nuanced methods of communication.</p>

<p>BA (Hons) International Development and Education is designed to help you develop a critical awareness of the intersectional issues in international development and education. This offers a great opportunity for a number of career choices, and a solid foundation for further experience and study in the sector. There's an opportunity for you to undertake a professional placement year between your second and third year of study, which is particularly relevant if you want to continue your studies.</p>
<p>Broad and regular interaction with the field offers you a wealth of experience to reflect on in your learning.</p></div>","<div class=""collapsible-content-text""><p><strong>Year one</strong><br>We'll introduce you to the main development theories and approaches, and their history, and how these relate to the education sector. We'll explore the current donor and sector agendas, and how these reflect the different approaches.</p>
<p>This will provide a good foundation and overview, enabling you to confidently move into your second year. Year one will also include a core module with an optional overseas placement. We may, for example, travel to Catalonia to look at development issues around minority groups in a European context, relating your field experience to module theory. </p>
<p><strong>Year two</strong><br>You'll continue to draw on your knowledge and understanding of the theoretical underpinnings of the field, applying them to some contemporary dilemmas, including the very topical and timely issue of peace and conflict.</p>
<p>Understandings of different types of education, including youth programmes, adult learning, community capacity building, and activism and advocacy, will help you consider the multiple learning pathways that can meet the nuanced and diverse needs of different contexts.</p>
<p>An optional overseas visit is also included in this year. We'll be be going further afield, for example to Zambia, where we might explore the outcome of private agendas around school management in the copper belt, an area of increasing foreign investment and industrial activity.</p>
<p><strong>Optional placement year</strong><br>If you're serious about getting more involved in the development sector, a placement year will be invaluable. Learning through hands-on experience, alongside colleagues with years of expertise in the field, will help you understand and consolidate what you've been learning on the course, while introducing you to a network of inspirational people and programmes.</p>
<p><strong>Year three</strong><br>In your final year, you'll have the opportunity to dive deep into a subject that interests you, by conducting a piece of independent research. Your dissertation will give you the chance to apply the knowledge and skills learned on the course as you seek to consolidate your thoughts and experiences, ready to confidently move into the phase of your learning/career.</p>
<p>The (optional) annual trip in year three will focus on research methodologies. You'll be able to explore educational responses to development issues through participation and observation. For example, you may visit an NGO (non-governmental organisation) in rural Nepal, to gain specific knowledge and experience of community education.</p></div>","<div class=""collapsible-content-text""><p>The experiences and knowledge gained on this course may lead to a variety of career trajectories, including:</p>

<p>The PGCE year starts with an initial preparatory period which tackles the notion of the role of the teaching professional, with an emphasis on the Design and Technology practitioner. Through Professional Studies, and subject and pedagogical teaching modules, you'll begin to develop an understanding of the breadth of the role of the teacher as well as becoming familiar with the subject knowledge, skills, and pedagogies associated with your own particular subject.</p>
<p>Throughout the PGCE year, you'll track your experiences. Towards the end of the programme, you'll have the opportunity to undertake your own personalised professional development, through the opportunity to experience situations you have not yet come across.

A particular focus will be on the potential of using sound as a tool for narrative storytelling as well as a vehicle to communicate meaning. The module also involves advanced sound sculpting and processing techniques.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Alongside this core module, you’ll be offered a wide range of options. The Post Production module explores an industry-level workflow for Audio Post within film and visual media and covers a wide range of associated skillsets. Intertextuality in Sound Production, from the <a href=""/courses/pg-sound-production/"">Sound (Production)</a> pathway, explores the overlap between Urban Music production and what are considered more experimental genres. The Visual Music module, from the <a href=""/courses/pg-sound-arts/"">Sound (Arts)</a> pathway, explores the idea that musical thinking can be extended to the visual, and encourages students to develop multimedia projects that explore this idea. There are also choices in Composition, Performance, Musicology, and Professional Practice.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Trimester three</strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You’ll complete the course with an independent research project. While most postgraduate courses include a dissertation, MA Sound Design culminates with a large-scale practical project, supported by a reflective account.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The project will allow you to develop your own individual and original research area, through your practice. The exact nature of this work will be negotiated with the module leader. You’ll be able to use it to develop a body of practical work which will serve as a substantial portfolio for the next stage in your career.</span></strong></p></div>","<div class=""collapsible-content-text""><p>You can use the course to develop an individually-tailored portfolio of skills. This will equip you for the current employment landscape, where a combination of traditional audio post production roles are required alongside broader practice in sound, music and other media.</p>
<p>The course also provides the breadth necessary for FE and HE teaching in the field, and provides the basis required for PhD research and beyond.</p>

"Sound (Arts), MA",,,"https://www.bathspa.ac.uk/courses/pg-sound-arts/",,,,"Postgraduate degree ",,,,,,,14700,7600,"Annual",2020,"Pound",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"<div class=""collapsible-content-text""><p>The course caters for those working in a wide variety of music genres, and at the same time also covers areas of practice such as soundscape recording and sound design, interactive audio (for applications such as live performance, gaming, VR, immersive environments, and installations), spatial audio, hardware/software (instrument) design, and interdisciplinary practice incorporating other media.</p>
<p>Most students won’t cover all of these areas, but will use the course to develop an individually-tailored portfolio of skills, experience, and top-level work across them. We believe this to be appropriate to the current employment landscape, where many combine traditional roles in music with broader practice in sound and other media. The course also provides the breadth necessary for FE and HE teaching in this field, and provides a basis, where required, for PhD research and beyond.</p>
<p>A large number of options available within the course makes this choice and specialism possible. The course is part of a suite of courses available across music and sound, operating alongside ""sister"" pathways in <a href=""/courses/pg-sound-design/"">Sound Design</a> and <a href=""/courses/pg-sound-production/"">Sound Production</a>, which allow further specialism in these areas.</p></div>","<div class=""collapsible-content-text""><p><strong>Trimester one</strong></p>
<p>Gain the skills you’ll need to fulfil the rest of the course.</p>
<p>The Skills Portfolio module is built on the idea that you’ll already have technical skills in this area, but that students entering the course have differing skillsets, depending on background. It therefore allows you to choose a handful of skills projects from a large number of options – these cover skills right across the Sound Arts, <a href=""/courses/pg-sound-design/"">Sound Design</a> and <a href=""/courses/pg-sound-production/"">Sound Production</a> pathways and include (optional) elements of multimedia.</p>
<p>The Research Methodology and Context module develops skills in postgraduate-level research and writing. It is designed to give you the tools for an onward journey in academia, but not to be, in the colloquial sense, ""academic"". It encourages your research to be around the practical and creative elements core to your practice, and therefore to feed your creative work.</p>
<p><strong>Trimester two</strong></p>
<p>At the centre of trimester two, and MA Sound (Arts), is the Sonic Architecture module. This is intended as an expansion of traditional music composition teaching (an area in which we have long-standing expertise), where the aesthetic, rather than technical, aspects of individual work will be examined and developed. Through intensive tutorial support, you’ll be encouraged to explore your work at a structural level. Our teaching on this module recognises that spatial, multimedia, and interactive elements bring aesthetic challenges. We therefore offer a creative model that can be applied across the full range of artistic activity represented by the course.</p>
<p>Alongside this core module, you’ll be offered a wide range of options. The Visual Music module explores the idea that musical thinking can be extended to the visual, and encourages students to develop multimedia projects that explore this idea. Intertextuality in Sound Production, from the <a href=""/courses/pg-sound-production/"">Sound Production</a> pathway, explores the overlap between Urban Music production and what are considered more experimental genres. Post Production, from the <a href=""/courses/pg-sound-design/"">Sound Design</a> pathway, explores an industry-level workflow for Audio Post for picture. There are also choices in Composition, Performance, Musicology and Professional Practice.</p>
<p><strong>Trimester three</strong></p>
<p>Trimester three represents the culmination of the course in an independent research project. While in most postgraduate courses, the equivalent module (often known as ""the Master's module"") will consist of a dissertation, in this case it comprises a large-scale practical project. It will fulfil the same function in allowing you to develop your own individual and original research area, but here through your practice.

<p>The programme encourages interdisciplinary and collaborative working methods with students from the wider music community at Bath Spa, as well as visual media and other departments within the University.</p>
<p>While the programme has a music production focus, it also covers key areas of practice such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sound design</li>
<li>Electronic music composition</li>
<li>Soundscape and field recording</li>

<p>Gain the skills you’ll need to fulfil the rest of the course.</p>
<p>The Skills Portfolio module is built on the idea that you’ll already have technical skills in this area, but that students entering the course have differing skillsets, depending on background. It therefore allows you to choose a handful of skills projects from a large number of options – these cover skills right across the Sound (Production), <a href=""/courses/pg-sound-design/"">Sound (Design)</a> and <a href=""/courses/pg-sound-arts/"">Sound (Arts)</a> pathways and include (optional) elements of multimedia.</p>
<p>The Research Methodology and Context module develops skills in postgraduate-level research and writing. It is designed to give you the tools for an onward journey in academia, but not to be, in the colloquial sense, ""academic"". It encourages your research to be around the practical and creative elements core to your practice and therefore to feed your creative work.</p>
<p><strong>Trimester two</strong></p>
<p>You’ll advance the knowledge gained in the the first trimester and begin exploring the intertextual possibilities of music composition. In addition, you’ll develop a creative project that will further extend the work undertaken on the trimester one Skills Portfolio module.</p>
<p>The Intertextuality In Sound Production module aims to capture and contextualise emerging trends and innovation at the forefront of sound production and composition, and develop composition skills that extend beyond the limits of genre. You’ll produce practical outputs exploring a range of influences from a rich milieu of sound-related practices. The ultimate goal of the module is the creation of new music that explores the continuum between contemporary electronic music and more avant-garde musical forms.</p>
<p>Alongside the Sound (Production) modules, there are additional optional modules that you can study from the other pathways. From the <a href=""/courses/pg-sound-arts/"">Sound (Arts)</a> pathway, the Visual Music module explores the idea that musical thinking can be extended to the visual, and encourages students to develop multimedia projects that explore this idea. Sonic Architecture centres around the construction and organisation of sound, and focuses on the tensions that may be explored and exploited in both the spatial and temporal domains.</p>
<p>From the <a href=""/courses/pg-sound-design/"">Sound (Design)</a> pathway, the Post Production module explores an industry-level workflow for audio post production for picture. There are also choices in composition, performance, musicology and professional practice.</p>
<p><strong>Trimester three</strong></p>
<p>Trimester three represents the culmination of the course in an independent research project. While most Master's level courses consist of a substantial written dissertation component, the MA Sound (Production) programme focuses more on high-level practical work and the concept of ""practice as research"" through the creation of a large-scale practical project.</p>
<p>The project will fulfil the same function as the traditional dissertation; you’ll develop individual and original research, but through the creation of a portfolio of works, rather than through the written word. You’ll develop a body of practical work which will serve as a substantial portfolio for the next stage in your career.</p></div>","<div class=""collapsible-content-text""><p>You can use the course to develop an individually-tailored portfolio of skills. This will equip you for the current employment landscape, where a combination of traditional music roles is required, alongside broader practice in sound and other media.</p>

You'll learn from each other’s mistakes and successes, as well as your own. You'll be urged to try things out, take risks and experiment, and reflect on and discuss the writing process. The context modules help you to see your own writing in the wider context of published children’s writing. The course encourages you to read widely and analytically.</span></strong></p></div>","<div class=""collapsible-content-text""><p><strong>Trimester one</strong></p>
<p>In the first trimester’s writing workshop, you’ll explore a variety of forms of writing to gain a sense of different age ranges and styles of writing and experiment with your own writing. We encourage all our students to experiment and take risks at this stage of the course.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The context module, Writing for Young People: Forms, Ages and Stages, is concerned with the writer’s relationship with the audience, and will help you understand some of the issues raised by writing for young people. You'll read one set text each week to discuss in class, reading ""as a writer"", looking closely at language and style, in addition to writing short pieces of your own creative work.</span><span style=""font-weight: 400;""><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Trimester two</strong><strong><br></strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In the second trimester’s workshop, you'll be asked to choose your area of writing and use the workshop’s feedback and encouragement to explore it in more depth. You'll bring short excerpts from your work-in-progress for discussion and feedback in the group. You may continue to experiment with different ideas for other stories.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The second trimester’s Context Module looks at contemporary children’s publishing, and aims to give a realistic grasp of the choices open to new writers in the field. This is your chance to learn about how the publishing industry works, and to develop the professional skills you need as a working author.</span> </p>
<p><strong><strong>Trimester three</strong><strong><br></strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In Trimester three, you'll continue to write your work-in-progress, editing and re-drafting your work to help you develop a manuscript as near to publishable quality as possible.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You’ll be supported by tutorials with a manuscript supervisor. The manuscript may be a novel, a collection of stories, a collection of poems or picture book text. Most of our students choose to write a novel for young people.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Part-time students follow the same sequence of modules, but do so over two years.</span></strong></p></div>","<div class=""collapsible-content-text""><p>Graduates have achieved publication deals with a range of different mainstream and smaller publishers, including Andersen Press, Bloomsbury, Chicken House, Egmont, Faber &amp; Faber, Gullane, Hot Key Books, Nosy Crow, Orion, Oxford University Press, Penguin, Quercus, Scholastic, Simon and Schuster, Templar and Walker Books. Many more students have secured literary agents and are likely to secure publication deals in the future. </p>
