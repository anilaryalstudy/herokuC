                    <div>Our foundation year is perfect if you want to study for a degree in medical physiology but you don’t have the standard qualifications, if you’re not sure if this is the right degree for you or you’re coming from an extended break in education.<br>
<br>
Our foundation year modules will bring you up to speed with the needed academic skills and give you a firm grounding in the subject. After which you can stay on your chosen BSc or change to one of our other eligible BSc degrees.
<div>
This BSc in Medical Physiology offers you an exceptional opportunity to study the complex anatomy and detailed function of the human body in both health and disease.</div>
<div>
We place a strong emphasis on learning all about the body’s structure and functions, with a particular focus on anatomy, histology, biochemistry and pharmacology.</div>
<div>
We’ll give you a practical insight into the techniques and instrumentation used to investigate the human body in varying states of health and disease, such as fitness tests, chest X-rays and electrocardiograms (ECG), which measure the electrical activity of the heart.</div>
<div>
You’ll examine life support systems and have the chance to earn a first-aid qualification. You’ll also discover what happens when body systems break down and how this can lead to disease.</div>
<div>
You’ll have the option to take our four-year placement course, which features a year’s work experience, normally in a laboratory, after your second year. We’ve seen how such placements often lead to full-time jobs.<br>

Our internationally renowned academics and fantastic facilities at UEL, including VR and dedicated research labs, will allow you to experience and learn all about modern Psychology in today's climate.<br>
<br>

The world is filled with advertising, from street billboards to TV catchphrases, from the back of newspapers to the front of football shirts, from internet pop-ups to… well, anywhere with an empty space to fill. It’s a huge, rich part of our everyday life and cultural experience – and it’s changing fast.<br>
<br>
At UEL, we offer you a unique insight into this exciting, swift-moving world. You’ll learn all about the advertising industry: what it does, how it works and how it’s changing in relation to the world that it shapes and that helps shape it.<br>
<br>
You’ll learn about branding, market research techniques and digital media production, and take a detailed look at how today’s consumer society works. <br>
<br>
Guided by industry experts, you’ll have the best chance not just to study but also to learn while at work in this ever-expanding industry.<br>
<br>
You’ll be involved in work placements and consumer research projects. We’ll give you the chance to study everything from promotional media practices to photography and cultural theory while you also learn the best media and digital production skills.<br>

                    <p>Whether it’s the fun of Super Mario or the horror of Resident Evil that consumes you, this is your chance to convert your passion for playing games into knowledge about how to create and design them.</p>
<p>You’ll get the most out of our course if you come with an interest in all kinds of games – board, card and pen-and-paper - not just digital ones. You’ll be amazed what you can learn from games like Munchkin or Dungeons and Dragons.</p>
<p>We run two games courses at UEL, subtly different but both sharing the same focus on designing games and game play.</p>
<p>Our course will equip you, like many of our successful graduates, for a role in the expanding games industry. We're justly proud of the imagination and quality of our students’ work.<br>
By the end of your course, you should be playing a game you designed yourself – and hopefully following in the footsteps of the many UEL graduates now making their mark in the games industry.<br>

                    <div>This extended course is perfect if you want a degree in Civil Engineering but you don’t have the standard entry requirements.
<div> <br>
First we prepare you for your degree during an extra Foundation year, bringing you up to speed with academic skills and a firm grounding in the subject. Then you can go on to do the full BSc.</div>
<div><br>
The course will give you a solid grounding in the design, construction and management of civil engineering work.</div>
<div><br>
We have great links with industry and high levels of graduate employment. You’ll enjoy regular visits to iconic construction sites in London as well as professionally monitored field study courses and projects.</div>
<div><br>
This makes our course ideal for students who, while not necessarily ‘maths geniuses’, nevertheless have good basic skills in that area and aspirations to develop a career in management or a range of technical fields.<br>

                    <p>Ensuring that a building project runs smoothly, with enough materials, equipment, workers and money to deliver it, is a huge task. So, too, is monitoring construction quality and progress.</p>
<p>This course will give you the knowledge and contacts to take on that kind of responsibility.</p>
<p>You’ll learn a broad range of skills in your first year, sharing modules with Civil Engineering and Surveying. Later you can choose to specialise in specific construction management disciplines.</p>
<p>There are so many aspects to construction management – sorting out resources, materials and labour, planning transport routes. It’s all about what we call ‘supply chain management’. You have to make sure everything runs efficiently – and that means a lot of work in many different areas.  </p>
<p>You need to have good inter-personal skills and be comfortable working as part of a large team. And you have to keep in mind your client’s requirements at all times. This course will help you learn how to juggle all these responsibilities successfully.</p>

<p>The future of financial transactions, applications and management of finances is expected to be impacted heavily by FinTech. We have already started to see the application of FinTech e.g. cryptocurrency,
crowdfunding, mobile payment systems in the business world and the economy at large. As such, it is important for future graduates to understand the trends and innovations in the financial industry.
Students choosing this pathway will have a good grasp of not only the foundations and applications of FinTech but also on the strategic implementation of FinTech in the business world and the economy at
large.</p>

                    <p>The Professional Doctorate in Fine Art has been running at UEL for
over 20 years. It is designed for artists working across a range of media
and methodologies who wish to make their practice the basis for doctoral
study.  </p>
<p>Unlike a PhD, an exhibition of artworks replaces the thesis as the
main evidence of research, supported by a 15,000 – 20,000-word written
report.  The programme is designed for artists from the UK and abroad and
is undertaken 3 years full time and 5 years part time.  </p>
<p>Students are
engaged in any of the forms of contemporary art, including painting,
printmaking, sculpture, film, installation, photography, text-based and digital
work.  They arrive with a creative practice to be analysed and developed
rather than a research question or a project to be carried out.
Work-in-progress seminars are the backbone to the programme, building critical,
creative and presentational skills and peer support.  </p>
<p>Along with
twice-yearly exhibitions within and outside of the university, students are
given the support to develop their creative practice, professional practice and
theoretical research to a doctoral standard. </p>

                                    The most popular course is the PhD via MPhil. A PhD is an
original and distinct contribution to the knowledge of the field of study. It
is often essential for those wishing to follow an academic or research career
in industry or commerce. PhD research can be carried out in all subject areas.<br>
<br>
All Postgraduate Research students are supervised by at least two
research-active staff. Your supervisors will support your programme of research
through regular meetings and reviews.<br>
<br>
The PhD via MPhil course normally takes a minimum of 36 months (full-time) 60
months (part-time) to complete. Students enrolled in full-time mode of study will
transfer from the MPhil to a PhD usually at the two year stage or equivalent
for part-time study.<br>
<br>
At the end of your PhD, you will be required to submit an
80,000-word thesis, summarising your research. You will then have to undergo an
oral examination (a viva) on your thesis.<br>

                    <p>This multi-disciplinary course analyses the impact of capitalist neoliberalism on development. It examines neoliberal policies over the last 30 years and their effects on urban layout, property markets, architectural form and social justice. Although sited within the architecture department we welcome applicants from a wide range of backgrounds and disciplines.<br>
<br>
The course is comprised of four modules: Reading the Neoliberal City; Psychogeography and Situationism; Ethical Development and the Digital City. Topics for study include the housing crisis and the privatisation of cities, investigating the financialisation of the urban environment, polarisation and the consequences for citizens in terms of trust and fear. The modules on Ethical Development and the Digital City focus on potential alternatives to the neoliberal city. </p>

Architecture at UEL is based in our Docklands campus, in a pioneer area for neoliberal development and a key study site for the course. But while London is the focus, the global impact of these processes, which are relevant across the world, provides the context.<br>

                    <p><strong>* This course is subject to validation</strong></p>
<p>The Data Science and Artificial Intelligence with Foundation Year programme is perfect if you want a degree in the field, but do not have the standard entry requirements.</p>
<p>This programme combines two key areas of computing, namely data science and artificial intelligence, in a synergistic manner. Data science and Artificial Intelligence are two complementary areas of Intelligent Systems, with data science focusing on statistical techniques and Artificial Intelligence on algorithmic techniques. Both areas are in high demand in the tech industry and for Industry 4.0. <br>
<br>
Data science and Artificial Intelligence jobs are amongst the best paid in the IT sector with both skills in ever increasing demand. A recent report by the European Union predicts that there will be a need for 346,000 Data Scientist and Machine Learning experts by 2020. However, the UK faces a potentially crippling shortage of such professionals, threatening businesses in the UK.<br>
<br>
This course seeks to address the chronic shortage of suitably qualified data science and Artificial Intelligence specialists and, at the same time, prepare you for a fulfilling and varied career in this fast growing IT sector.<br>

                                    The most popular course is the PhD via MPhil. A PhD is an
original and distinct contribution to the knowledge of the field of study. It
is often essential for those wishing to follow an academic or research career
in industry or commerce. PhD research can be carried out in all subject areas.<br>
<br>
All Postgraduate Research students are supervised by at least two
research-active staff. Your supervisors will support your programme of research
through regular meetings and reviews.<br>
<br>
The PhD via MPhil course normally takes a minimum of 36 months (full-time) 60
months (part-time) to complete. Students enrolled in full-time mode of study will
transfer from the MPhil to a PhD usually at the two year stage or equivalent
for part-time study.<br>
<br>
At the end of your PhD, you will be required to submit an
80,000-word thesis, summarising your research. You will then have to undergo an
oral examination (a viva) on your thesis.<br>

We are looking for practitioners who are seeking to extend their use of psychology with children, young people and families.  You will need the Graduate Basis for Certification with the BPS and relevant experience. Full details of the application requirements and processes are available from <a href=""http://www.aep.org.uk/training/"" target=""_blank"">The Association of Educational Psychologists</a>.<br>
<br>
In recent years, around half of our students have been teachers or Assistant Educational Psychologists, while other professions represented have included Teaching Assistants, mental health and clinical practitioners, youth workers and social workers. Many have postgraduate qualifications as well as a depth of relevant paid experience.
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The course meets both the Health and Care Professions
Council (HCPC) standards and the Division of Educational and Child Psychology –
British Psychological Society (DECP) criteria for three-year training. <br>
<br>
Successful applicants are expected to confirm their
fitness to study and practice at the start of the programme. Potential
applicants need to be aware of these requirements prior to application. Once on
the programme, trainees are expected to maintain their health and well-being throughout the duration of the programme and in line with the HCPC's guidance on conduct and ethics, to let the education provider know if their health status changes.<br>
<br>
The programme is doctoral level and the overall credit rating for this course is 540 credits. This is a national standard for Professional Doctorates. If for some reason you are unable to achieve this credit you may be entitled to an intermediate award, the level of the award will depend on the amount of credit you have accumulated. You can read the full University Student Policies and Regulations on the UEL website. Because the title of Educational Psychologist is protected it is important to be clear that any award other than that achieved by successful completion of the full Doctorate programme will not entitle you to use the title Educational Psychologist. The title can only be used following successful completion and subsequent registration with the HCPC. The AEP also place stipulations related to completion in the contract for a funded place.<br>

                    <p>This long-established and hugely popular course is fully accredited by the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP).</p>
<p>It is designed to provide training in an integrative approach to counselling and psychotherapy. It will enable you to develop your own synthesis within a framework which is not tied to a particular theoretical school or perspective. <span class=""scWebEditInput scEnabledChrome"" id=""fld_1C4801EA4EE84828AD9BB174270313BC_F789A1D6810744889087D0733738B939_en_1_53301af43e344956b122e0a86bff3432_27889_edit"" contenteditable=""true"">We
follow current research into what actually works in counselling and
psychotherapy, which means we use an integrative approach, employing a
variety of techniques to respond to the needs and preferences of
individual clients.</span></p>
<p>Typically, students on this course will have first degrees in other subjects, and they may be employed either part-time or full-time.  </p>
<p>You may be working in health, social care or education – but you don’t have to be.</p>
<p>This course (two years for the Diploma) is ideally suited to those with a part-time job, although it can also work for those with full-time commitments. The basis of study for the Postgraduate Diploma is one afternoon/evening per week.</p>
<p>The two-year Postgraduate Diploma allows you to practice as a BACP registered counsellor.  Completion of the diploma confers automatic entry to the MA Counselling and Psychotherapy final year which is a popular choice for our students. (Only the Masters is eligible for a student loan from SFE.)</p>
<p>The Postgraduate Diploma entails completing 100 hours of supervised work, which will be undertaken on a placement which you have to secure for yourself. However, the School has established links with  many agencies and practices where our students have worked over the years.</p>
<p>You may take these skills back into your workplace, use them for a change of career, or develop your own specialist practice.</p>

                                    The most popular course is the PhD via MPhil. A PhD is an original and distinct contribution to the knowledge of the field of study. It is often essential for those wishing to follow an academic or research career in industry or commerce. PhD research can be carried out in all subject areas.<br>
<br>
All Postgraduate Research students are supervised by at least two research-active staff. Your supervisors will support your programme of research through regular meetings and reviews.<br>
<br>
The PhD via MPhil course normally takes a minimum of 36 months (full-time) 60 months (part-time) to complete. Students enrolled in full-time mode of study will transfer from the MPhil to a PhD usually at the two year stage or equivalent for part-time study.<br>
<br>
At the end of your PhD, you will be required to submit an 80,000-word thesis, summarising your research. You will then have to undergo an oral examination (a viva) on your thesis.<br>

                    <p>Mechanical engineering is surely one of the most demanded and popular engineering disciplines. It is predicted that, in the United Kingdom alone, there will be demand for 100,000 new STEM (Science, Technology and Engineering) professionals per year, thus the Royal Academy of Engineering sent out a message that ‘Demand for graduate engineers exceeds supply’. As it is a requirement to have an MEng or MSc engineering qualification to achieve an professional affiliation like Chartered Engineer status, an MSc programme would address your needs to attain such status and widen and deepen your skill set for solving 21st century technical challenges.
<br>
<br>
With the recent significant investment in engineering programmes and laboratory facilities, this programme is customised for you to meet the increasing demand for general engineering professionals with advanced technical skills in the mechanical and wider engineering sector. The programme is designed to be a broad and challenging taught postgraduate course, which would be ideal for those who seek a postgraduate qualification to enhance their knowledge, skills, and therefore their employability. The programme would furnish you with the skill sets that are required by industries.
<br>
<br>
The interactive programme will provide you fundamental and advanced engineering knowledge and hands-on skills that a professional engineer needs for solving technical complex issues with a multi-disciplinary innovative and strategic approach. The programme is aimed at both the home and overseas market and, in particular, students working in the general engineering and technical/management sector or students who would wish to work in these sectors.

                                    The most popular course is the PhD via MPhil. A PhD is an original and distinct contribution to the knowledge of the field of study. It is often essential for those wishing to follow an academic or research career in industry or commerce. PhD research can be carried out in all subject areas.<br>
<br>
All Postgraduate Research students are supervised by at least two research-active staff. Your supervisors will support your programme of research through regular meetings and reviews.<br>
<br>
The PhD via MPhil course normally takes a minimum of 36 months (full-time) 60 months (part-time) to complete. Students enrolled in full-time mode of study will transfer from the MPhil to a PhD usually at the two year stage or equivalent for part-time study.<br>
<br>
At the end of your PhD, you will be required to submit an 80,000-word thesis, summarising your research. You will then have to undergo an oral examination (a viva) on your thesis.<br>

                    <p>The Master of Science in Integrative Counselling and
Coaching is a unique and ground-breaking course. It is the only postgraduate
course in the UK, and possibly in the world, that offers integration of
counselling and coaching practices.<br>
<br>
This course provides professional training to those who aim
to integrate various counselling approaches and coaching in their one-to-one
practice.<br>
<br>
Broadly speaking, counselling concerns itself with the resolution
of internal conflicts and psychological changes. Coaching deals more with goal
achievement and behavioural changes. For example, counselling may address
underlining issues and reasons why someone had a drink problem, while coaching
would deal with the habit itself. Although there is some overlap between these
two approaches, they are not interchangeable. However, they can be
complementary.<br>
<br>
By covering both counselling and coaching training, this
course is answering an ever-increasing need for integrative practitioners.<br>
After completing the first two years of this course you will
be able to apply for registered membership of BACP and eventual accreditation
(as it is the case with all other training courses, the latter requires
additional practice hours).</p>

                                    The most popular course is the PhD via MPhil. A PhD is an original and distinct contribution to the knowledge of the field of study. It is often essential for those wishing to follow an academic or research career in industry or commerce. PhD research can be carried out in all subject areas.<br>
<br>
All Postgraduate Research students are supervised by at least two research-active staff. Your supervisors will support your programme of research through regular meetings and reviews.<br>
<br>
The PhD via MPhil course normally takes a minimum of 36 months (full-time) 60 months (part-time) to complete. Students enrolled in full-time mode of study will transfer from the MPhil to a PhD usually at the two year stage or equivalent for part-time study.<br>
<br>
At the end of your PhD, you will be required to submit an 80,000-word thesis, summarising your research. You will then have to undergo an oral examination (a viva) on your thesis.<br>

                    <p>This is a conversion course for students with a first degree in another subject area. It means you could go on and train to be a professional psychologist – for example, by studying for a Doctorate in Clinical Psychology.<br>
<br>
You may, however, simply want to study this course because you are interested in the subject, in which case you will return to your career enriched with knowledge of human behaviour.</p>
<p>A concentrated lecture schedule – Wednesday afternoon and evening for those studying full-time, and if you study part-time you have the option of either Wednesday afternoons or evenings, which means you can combine the study with your current commitments.<br>
<br>
Some of our students have obtained a psychology degree overseas but have now moved to the UK and need to add the Graduate Basis for Chartership (GBC) qualification to further their careers. This course ticks that box.<br>
<br>
You will benefit from excellent and highly experienced teaching in an internationally recognised school close to the London 2012 Olympic Park in Stratford, in a vibrant area with shopping centres and transport hubs.</p>

                    <p>The media industries that inform and entertain are also leading sectors of employment. This course explores both the cultural and economic aspects of media. Today, more than ever, media professionals need to understand the cultures, forms and practices of contemporary communication industries, and recognize and respond to changing conditions, challenges and policy issues. You will explore media and marketing communications industries from the global to the local, and from political economic aspects to the creativity of media practitioners and users. You will examine contemporary convergence across media, marketing and promotional industries and will be supported in your independent investigation into chosen aspects of digital publishing, audiovisual and social media, advertising, public relations and other marketing communications industries.</p>
<p>This MA offers a stimulating and wide-ranging programme supporting routes into both postgraduate research and careers in the creative industries in content creation and operations, management, research, policy and other support services. The programme will help you develop both academic and applied skills through research and study, innovative work/study experience, and production.</p>

Design of any scale responds to – and in parallel leads – cultural and social change. Our everyday living changes rapidly. The changing demographics, the emergence of new technologies, shift the way in which we inhabit, use and share spaces. What is the role of design in the rapidly changing contemporary conditions? What is the office space of the future like? What is the library of the future? What is the shop of the future? Through our MA in Interior Design programme we address some of the above questions in a rigorous, experimental and creative manner. Through a fun and hands-on approach we will debate and challenge one another on some of the most current and ‘hot’ design related questions.</p>

a space of discussion which brings together artists, scholars, and
activists to create new types of cultural productions that transcend,
rather than merely criticise, the status quo? Then MA Contemporary
Performance Practices may be where your ideas belong.
</p>
<p>Contemporary Performance Practices breaks traditional
disciplinary borders to explore how performance can help us
respond to social, environmental, and ecological changes and
challenges. The Programme provides a unique and tailored
education to prepare graduates for new opportunities within the
performing arts industry. The curriculum centres on a dynamic
blend of critical, practice-based engagement with performance
across artistic genres and disciplines; from experimental theatre,
music, dance and community-based practices, to live art, interactive
and participatory performance, sound art, and installation. </p>
<p>You will be immersed in a variety of ideas, approaches and forms, and, at
the same time have ample opportunities to focus on your own area
of interest. Throughout the programme you will explore cutting edge
and interdisciplinary approaches to performance making and
develop original work leading to your final dissertational project
which will be a unique performance on a specific area of enquiry.</p>

<p>We believe architecture is about engagement. Rather than sitting in a studio designing buildings theoretically you will go out and work on projects in the local area – a thriving, dynamic part of London with huge infrastructure developments.</p>
<p>You will fulfil your creative potential and perfect your skills by working on designs that tackle real-life issues not just in east London but around the world.</p>
<p>You will engage with architectural events nationally and internationally. In 2014, our students exhibited as part of the Venice Biennale and at the London Festival of Architecture.</p>
<p>Our MArch Architecture course is fully accredited, furthering your progress towards becoming a qualified architect. </p>
<p>Students who successfully complete the course are exempt from Part 2 of the ARB/RIBA Examination – one of the three parts required to register as an architect in the UK.</p>

                    <p>A master’s degree in law is a fantastic way for law graduates to develop a specialisation, or for non-lawyers working in related fields to gain a deeper understanding of legal issues.</p>
<p>This LLM pathway combines specialist study of international law, with valuable practical training in advocacy, legal practice and litigation skills. You’ll be taught fundamental topics in international law at the cutting-edge of current research, while simultaneously developing the necessary legal skills to apply your knowledge in a clinical context. You’ll also have the chance to diversify your training through extensive module options.</p>
<p>Alongside the optional modules, you may choose to either write a 15,000 word dissertation or conduct a work-based project that will give you valuable experience of dealing with a specific legal issue in detail.</p>
<p>The course is perfect for lawyers and law graduates looking for career development, although all of our LLM courses can be studied by students without a background in law, since you will be trained in the necessary analytical and legal skills.</p>
<p>The programme also offers an optional placement year, following your first year. Placements will be provided and supported either by us or a partner organisation where you'll gain worthwhile and practical real-world experience in handling issues relating to aspects of social welfare law. This is a unique and exceptional opportunity for you to work in law. International students wanting to do the Placement year must indicate so upon application. </p>
<p>As such, the programme will also provide ideal training for paralegals, journalists, NGO and charity workers, policy advisors, consultants, lawyers, those working in business and finance or anyone who will benefit from a legal education in their career.</p>

                    <p>Put an international perspective on your legal studies with this popular combination. As a qualifying law degree, it will still exempt you from the academic stage of qualifying as a solicitor or barrister.</p>
<p>The law doesn’t operate in isolation and in this course you’ll gain valuable insights into the global political context of the law as well as the social and cultural aspects of how the legal system functions.</p>
<p>Three-quarters of the course focuses on law, so you’ll learn how law is made and administered, gain an understanding of the criminal justice system and study key aspects of the civil and criminal law.</p>
<p>For the international relations part of the course, we’ll give you a solid introduction to the subject in your first year. You’ll then take one international relations module in each of your second and third years.</p>

                    <p>A master’s degree in law is a fantastic way for law graduates to develop a specialisation, or for non-lawyers working in related fields to gain a deeper understanding of legal issues.</p>
<p>This LLM pathway is a unique course that allows you to specialise in human rights from a highly practical perspective; the focus on advocacy translates into valuable clinical skills that enable you to put your knowledge of human rights law into practice. You’ll study the core principles of human rights advocacy, rooted in knowledge of the European Convention on Human Rights, developing expertise in an increasingly vital area of law that has implications for individuals throughout the world facing discrimination and persecution.</p>
<p>Alongside the optional modules, you may choose to either write a 15,000 word dissertation or conduct a work-based project that will give you valuable experience of dealing with a specific legal issue in detail.</p>
<p>The course is perfect for lawyers and law graduates looking for career development, although all of our LLM courses can be studied by students without a background in law, since you will be trained in the necessary analytical and legal skills.</p>
<p>The programme also offers an optional placement year, following your first year. Placements will be provided and supported either by us or a partner organisation where you'll gain worthwhile and practical real-world experience in handling issues relating to aspects of social welfare law. This is a unique and exceptional opportunity for you to work in law. International students wanting to do the Placement year must indicate so upon application. </p>
<p>As such, the programme will also provide ideal training for paralegals, journalists, NGO and charity workers, policy advisors, consultants, lawyers, those working in business and finance, or anyone who will benefit from a legal education in their career.</p>

                    <p>Early childhood continues to be a rapidly changing field in the local and global context.  Enhanced qualifications in this subject will support your career progression and employability whether you work in early childhood settings in the private, voluntary or public sectors in the United Kingdom or internationally.</p>
<p>At UEL we recognise that the study of early childhood needs a holistic perspective.  Early childhood practice is influenced by social, cultural, economic and political contexts.  Modules on this course will develop your knowledge of early childhood practice in a range of contexts and your research skills.  Assignments provide opportunities for you to apply advanced knowledge and research skills in practice in the context of employed or voluntary work.</p>
<p>We have an academic team with experience of early childhood practice, family support, early intervention, child rights services, informal education, policy development, service development and teaching in the early years.  Our team has worked in the private, voluntary and public sector in different contexts.  </p>
<p>Whichever direction you choose we can guide you, drawing on our national and international experience.  Like you we are passionate about early childhood.   The structure of the course enables you to follow and develop your own interests in early childhood supported by knowledge of theory and advanced research skills.   Our goal is to motivate and inspire you as an early childhood leader and practitioner. </p>
<p>The local, national and global perspectives of our course mean that your student group will be diverse.  In the past years we have had students on the MA from the United States of America and China. </p>
<p><strong>Please note that you will not be eligible for postgraduate loan funding if you receive APL/ACL credits.  Student Finance guidance states that eligible master’s courses must be full, standalone courses worth 180 credits.

                    <p>The exploration, extraction, sale and distribution of natural resources, including fossil fuels and minerals, is a massive undertaking. It is a highly regulated industry with legal implications at every stage of the process. This new course gives a comparative, socio-legal approach.<br>
<br>
This distinctive master’s course examines upstream and downstream regulatory trends in oil, gas and minerals in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle East, placing this in the context of the broader economic, technological and environmental and sustainability issues that have an impact on the industry.<br>
<br>
You will learn how the law interacts with business, politics and finance in a sector that is under constant scrutiny.<br>
   <br>
If you are a law graduate, legal professional, or graduate in another subject who works in – or is hoping to work in – the mining, energy or natural resource sector or a related field, this master’s degree will be a wise choice.<br>
<br>
If you want to keep on working and earn while you learn, you can do so, as all of our classes take place in the evening and lectures are also made available as podcasts and posted online.</p>

                    <p>The impact of the 2012 Olympics and the rise in childhood obesity and other health problems means there’s probably never been a greater interest in the role that sport and exercise plays in people’s lives.</p>
<p>So where better, then, to study the subject in depth than in London’s Olympic heartland and at a university which takes sport and its role in the community so seriously? </p>
<p>It’s an exciting time to be involved in the sports industry. It’s growing and evolving as successive governments recognise the need for people to be active. Our course reflects this with its inclusive approach to sport and PE.</p>
<p>We’ll ensure you’re ready to deliver physical education or work in a community setting to improve people’s lives, both during your degree and in your subsequent career.</p>
<p>You’ll also explore ways of encouraging as many people as possible to throw themselves into sport and physical activity, particularly young people and those with disabilities.</p>

By the end of the degree you’ll gain the same qualification as those obtaining direct entry to the course but you’ll take one year longer to complete your studies.<br>

                    <p>Policing is changing - adapting and evolving to meet the needs and requirements of today and tomorrow's society. At the University of East London, we are developing a suite of qualifications for those already in policing or those wishing to join through our <a href=""https://www.uel.ac.uk/research/centre-of-professional-policing"">Centre of Professional Policing (the CoPP)</a>.</p>
<p>This course is for existing police officers with over three years of service (and out of their probation), and for those who have recently retired. It is a top-up final year, which recognises existing officers’ training, knowledge, skills abilities and practice, leading to a BSc (Hons) Policing Studies degree.</p>
<p>Serving police officers are encouraged to make
internal enquiries to their own respective police service for bursary
opportunities when applying to undertake this top-up degree. </p>
<p>Please contact Dr Sarah Jane Fox (the Director of the Centre of Professional Policing, at UEL) for further information and opportunities relating to our exciting and innovative suite of qualifications that will shortly become available - at <a href=""mailto:s.j.fox@uel.ac.uk?subject=Policing%20Studies%20Top-Up"">s.j.fox@uel.ac.uk</a></p>

                    <p>Law with Criminology is a popular combination for anyone who wants to focus on law and also gain valuable insights into the causes and consequences of crime.</p>
<p>You’ll study one criminology module each year, with the rest of your course devoted to law. After graduating, you’ll be exempt from the academic stage of qualifying as a solicitor or barrister.<br>
<br>
You’ll learn how law is made and administered, and its relationship with the broader social, political and cultural context in which it operates. For the criminology part of the course, you’ll receive a solid introduction to the subject, including an understanding of the criminal justice system, which includes the police, courts and prison systems.<br>
<br>
While much of the law course is compulsory, you’ll be able to choose from ten criminology modules in your second and third years to pursue areas that are of most interest to you.</p>

                    <p>Our MEng Civil Engineering degree, validated as a four-year course in 2014, is a fast track to the top of the civil engineering profession. It covers much of the same ground as the BEng qualification, while being additionally equivalent to an MSc degree. Your degree is accredited by the Joint Board of Moderators, which is made up of the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE), Institution of Structural Engineers (IStructE), and the Institute of Highway Engineers (IHE).  The Chartered Institution of Highways and Transportation (CIHT) have approved an application from the Permanent Way Institution (PWI).<br>
<br>
In order to see it through, you’ll have to be confident of your academic ability. To join the course you’ll need to have at least 120 UCAS points (new tariff), including both A2 mathematics and A2 physics.<br>
<br>
Students who are doing well in the second year of the BEng course are given the option to switch to this MEng Course, adding another year of study.</p>
<p>Our unique teaching approach aims to promote learning by doing through guiding you to use observational, prototyping and physical simulation methods in design, in addition to teaching you the theories, engineering principles and standards. You will be encouraged to be creative, innovative and to use advanced digital tools to shape your imaginations and translate them to specifications for structures and systems that you design. For example, in your final year modules, you will not only be designing structures from foundation to roof, but you will also use a suite of software and 3D manufacturing suites including 3D printers, plasma and laser cutting machines, robotic arm and clay printer as tools to bring your design into scaled reality.<br>
<br>
As well as completing numerous practical projects, which are a particularly important part of the MEng course, you’ll benefit from visits by top professionals who’ll offer you advice – and work opportunities. <br>
<br>
Our Docklands campus is ideally situated for studying iconic projects in the capital such as the Tate Modern Phase 2 Extension, the Canary Wharf Crossrail Station and the reconfiguration of the Olympic Stadium.</p>

                    <p>This course is ideal if you’re committed to living or working away from our School of Psychology in east London. Wherever you’re based, our academic and administrative teams will support you. They’re highly experienced in supporting distance learners. </p>
<p>The key advantages of this new course are that you have the flexibility of choosing when you can study and access to your own personal tutor as well as online forums. It follows the format of our highly successful campus-based degree, which has been developed within our highly respected School of Psychology over a period of more than 50 years.</p>
<p>While other universities may require some attendance, this course is delivered entirely online through our virtual learning environment, UELDirect. There’s no requirement for attendance in any of your modules. But this course requires a lot of self-discipline and time management is the key.<br>
<br>
“About a third of our students are in London, and a third live in the UK,” says Course Leader Dr Anna Stone. “We have others in countries across the world, including Thailand, Guatemala and all across Africa.</p>
<p>Whether you're working, or you have children to look after, or you're simply looking to keep your mind active - this course is perfect for you. </p>

                    <p>Our public health degree is an interdisciplinary programme, which broadens students’ horizons to explore health needs and the links between theory and practice in relation to the concepts and principles of public health.
<br>
<br>
A degree in public health is one that will equip you with skills and knowledge to improve and protect public health and the well-being of individuals, communities and populations. You will focus on how to tackle major health challenges and reduce inequalities at global, national and local levels. This degree aims to boost your chances of employability in the field of epidemiology, statistical analysis, public health training, public and social care, community health, and health care services.
<br>
<br>
You will be encouraged to take on a work placement so you can gain professional and practical skills through working with a local authority, social entity or an NGO. Working on one aspect of public health would help you contribute in improving healthcare service delivery, empowering people in building a healthy lifestyle and influencing health policy reform in London and beyond.</p>

                    <p style=""border: medium none;"" class=""BodyA"">Podiatrists study the structure and function of the whole body and specialise in the foot, ankle and lower limb.</p>
<p style=""border: medium none;"" class=""BodyA"">On graduating, you will be a qualified healthcare professional making your own clinical decisions. You will be ready to work alone or as part of a multi-disciplinary team to deliver preventative care, diagnosis and treatment of a wide range of problems affecting the lower limb.</p>
<p style=""border: medium none;"" class=""BodyA"">You will be taught about anatomy, physiology and pathology, and how the body reacts to illness and injury but always with a special focus on foot and lower limb problems.<br>
<br>
One of the distinctive features of this course is the vast amount of practical experience it gives you. Under supervision, you’ll start seeing patients at the start of the second term of your first year in our on-site Clinical Education Centre. You will also undertake clinical placements within National Health Service clinics across London and the east of England, beginning towards the end of your first year. </p>

                    <p>The University of East London is making swift strides towards its aim of becoming London’s No 1 university for sport, and our much-admired Sport and Exercise Science degree is leading the way.<br></p>
<p>Study our challenging course and you’ll be examining the role that biomechanics, physiology, psychology and nutrition play in human performance. You’ll also look at how these disciplines interact, so you receive the complete education a multi-disciplinary sports scientist needs.</p>
<p>You’ll have the chance to study optional subjects that give our course its special flavour – such as our module in disability sport.</p>
<p>It’s a course that has attracted some of Britain’s leading sportsmen and women of the day such as European 200m champion Adam Gemili, Commonwealth 200m bronze medallist Bianca Williams and double European and Commonwealth medal-winning swimmer Aimee Willmott. It also develops the sports scientists and teachers who’ll help deliver the champions of tomorrow. </p>
<p>If you want to know how good our course is, don’t just take our word for it. Listen to Adam.</p>
<p>“As an athlete you need to understand how your body works - the biomechanics,"" he says. ""That knowledge has really helped me when I’m in the blocks to get the biggest first step that I can.”</p>

                    <p>You will develop a good knowledge of the
influences on, and factors involved in, human functioning in all the core areas
of psychology:<br>
<br>
Biological foundations<br>
Cognitive Psychology<br>
Social Psychology<br>
Developmental Psychology<br>
Individual Differences<br>
Neuropsychological basis<br>
Research methods<br>
<br>
You
will also develop detailed knowledge of several specialised areas through option
modules, including knowledge of research paradigms, methods and measurement
techniques, real-life applications of theory to behaviour and experience, and
how behaviour and experience can be affected by physical and mental illness.
This knowledge will be backed up by subject-based practical skills such as the
ability to design and conduct research, to analyse and interpret quantitative
and qualitative data, and awareness of ethical issues and principles in
research on human behaviour. <br>
<br>
Key
to many careers and employers - you will also develop thinking skills,

                    <p>A master’s degree in law is a fantastic way for law
graduates to develop a specialisation, or for non-lawyers working in related
fields to gain a deeper understanding of legal issues. </p>
<p>Since law is a vast and diverse subject, we offer a huge
amount of flexibility in this general LLM programme. You also have the option
of taking one of our specialist pathways that focus on different topics (see
related courses below).</p>
<p>The pathways align to our major research strengths in areas
like legal education, international legal research and human rights – but you
can study modules from all these areas if you opt for the general LLM.
Alongside the optional modules, you may choose to either write a 15,000 word
dissertation or conduct a work-based project that will give you valuable experience

<p>This LLM pathway focuses your study on Business and Financial Law, introducing you to the contemporary legal and regulatory issues that govern international business and finance.

<p>Alongside the optional modules, you may choose to either write a 15,000 word dissertation or conduct a work-based project that will give you valuable experience of dealing with a specific legal issue in detail.</p>
<p>The course is perfect for lawyers and law graduates looking for career development, although all of our LLM courses can be studied by students without a background in law, since you will be trained in the necessary analytical and legal skills.</p>

Students wanting to do the Placement year must indicate so upon application.

                    <div>Our passion for pharmacology and our reputation for excellence stretches back to the distant days when the University of East London was called the West Ham Technical Institute.</div>
<div>
<br>
After half a century of studying drugs and how their application affects the prevention and treatment of disease, we’re now celebrating the landmark 50th anniversary of our pharmacology teaching and research at UEL.<br>
<br>
Not only are we sure we’ve never been better, but we think our future’s never been more exciting.<br>
<br>
A new, revamped course will equip you for a rewarding future in what our prize-winning, internationally recognised lecturers believe is the most fascinating  of the biosciences.<br>
<br>
We’ll give you a thorough introduction to every area of pharmacology through our diverse and flexible approach. You’ll also leave with a thorough understanding of areas such as molecular biology, physiology, microbiology, genetics and toxicology.<br>
<br>
You’ll be in the lab learning pharmacological techniques that will back up your lectures and demonstrate how medicines work.<br>
<br>
You’ll be involved in groundbreaking research projects and have access to excellent work opportunities. This could be in the form of an optional placement year or a shorter summer placement at a major organisation such as the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) or in our own labs working with our internationally recognised researchers.</div>

                    <p class=""BodyA"" style=""border: currentcolor;"">Physiotherapists treat patients of all ages, helping them to maximise functional movement caused by accidents, illness and disability. Their expertise helps improve mobility, independence and quality of life. <br>
<br>
This course prepares you to be a physiotherapist and includes the minimum of 1,000 clinical hours you need to qualify.<br>
<br>
You’ll learn how to treat patients and to communicate with them effectively, gaining hands-on experience from year one through your clinical placements in the National Health Service and private sector.<br>
<br>
You’ll also develop a thorough understanding of the human body, what happens when injuries occur and how to treat and manage them.<br>
<br>
We’ve worked hard with the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP) to ensure the course content is highly relevant. Our course is validated by the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC), so you can apply for registration with the HCPC and full membership of the CSP on graduation.<br>
<br>
Our graduates enjoy outstanding success in the jobs market. Six months after graduating, 95 per cent of them are already in a clinical position, according to 2016 government statistics. </p>
<p><a href=""https://hee.nhs.uk/"">We advise students to check Health Education England for regular up-to-date information.</a><br>
<br>
Applicants are required to complete an enhanced occupational health assessment to ensure that you are occupationally fit to work in the health and social care setting.

            <div class=""sc-course-summary__text-container js-responsive"">
                    <p>UEL, through the <a href=""https://www.uel.ac.uk/research/centre-of-professional-policing"">Centre of Professional Policing (CoPP)</a> offers a specific pre-join degree into policing. * The University of East London is licensed by the College of Policing to offer this Pre-join Degree in Professional Policing.</p>
<p>
The BSc (Hons) Professional Policing degree is a 3-year full-degree (with a part-time option) being offered at UEL and is designed to meet the role and challenges for policing. It is for those wishing to join the police* or enter into a similar career.</p>
<p>*NOTE: This degree does not guarantee entry into the police service. Students will need to apply to the respective police service/force and meet the selection criteria and requirements for entry. (This degree has a currency of 5-years after completion for this purpose.)</p>
<p>This degree recognises that, at an entry level into policing, amongst other tasks, the police constable is required to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Protect life and property</li>
    <li>Deter crime</li>
    <li>Provide a reassuring presence to diverse communities</li>
    <li>Support victims, witnesses and other vulnerable persons</li>
    <li>Conduct initial investigations</li>
    <li>Interview suspects</li>
</ul>
<p>The curriculum is as prescribed by the College of Policing and features learning and development across a comprehensive range of professional policing situations. This includes: evidence-based policing; decision making and discretion; criminology and crime prevention; pro-active approaches to vulnerability, risk and public protection. It is professionally transformative, in that there is comprehensive, modern and up-to-date coverage of areas of knowledge, skills and professional approaches that have been identified as critical to the 21st century policing role of the constable. This includes cybercrime and digital policing.<br>
<br>
Optional modules relate to Organised Crime and Contemporary Challenges; and Leadership, Coaching and Mentoring. </p>
<p>As policing requires a distinctive combination of applied skills and knowledge, this programme will help to develop critical thinking skills, communications and interpersonal skills, all required abilities related to policing. This includes legislation and police powers (policy and practice) structured interviewing and investigative skills, plus much more. Modules are constructed to provide ‘knowledge, theory and know-how’ relevant to operational policing.  This includes practical, hands-on experience, with a key factor of this degree providing for ‘practice and application’ of skills in simulated, safe environments. </p>
<p>This degree will combine all of these elements together while allowing ‘you’ the opportunity to take part in community placements which could be within one of a variety of areas relevant to the field of policing. (This includes as a member of the Special Constabulary.) Community involvement and work placements are therefore another significant and innovative approach of this degree. </p>
<p>Note: whilst this degree teaches knowledge, theory and skills associated with the police constable role, these would also be applicable and transferable to other investigatory and enforcement positions. <br>
This degree is therefore of relevance to anyone wishing to enter aligned work fields with many transferable skills, for example: this includes but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The National Crime Agency</li>
    <li>The intelligence sector</li>
    <li>The security sector</li>
    <li>Cybercrime, fraud, loss reduction and risk
    sector</li>
    <li>Border Force</li>
    <li>Investigatory positions - and Ombudsmen’s
    roles</li>
    <li>The Civil Service</li>
    <li>Central/Local Government (Ministries)</li>
    <li>Armed Services</li>
    <li>NGOs</li>
    <li>Probation Service</li>
    <li>Prison Service</li>
    <li>Victim support agencies</li>
    <li>Working with young offenders</li>
    <li>Community and charity sectors</li>
</ul>

                    <p><strong>*This course is subject to validation.</strong></p>
<p>This programme combines two key areas of computing, namely data science and artificial intelligence, in a synergistic manner. Data science and Artificial Intelligence are two complementary areas of Intelligent Systems, with Data science focusing on statistical techniques and Artificial Intelligence on algorithmic techniques. Both areas are in high demand in the tech industry and for Industry 4.0. <br>
<br>
Data science and Artificial Intelligence jobs are amongst the best paid in the IT sector with both skills in ever increasing demand. A recent report by the European Union predicts that there will be a need for 346,000 data scientist and machine learning experts by 2020. However, the UK faces a potentially crippling shortage of such professionals, threatening businesses in the UK.<br>
<br>
This course seeks to address the chronic shortage of suitably qualified data science and Artificial Intelligence specialists and, at the same time, prepare you for a fulfilling and varied career in this fast growing IT sector.<br>

                    <p>Our
exciting and highly stimulating Forensic Psychology course will equip you for a
future career in various roles within the wider criminal justice system.  The course is not solely focussing on
individuals and the reasons behind the crime but also examines how the various
social and psychological factors have an impact on lives and, in turn,
offending behaviour. <br>
Building
from the broad grounding we’ll give you in basic psychology, you’ll specialise
in evaluating the dynamic interplay between psychological and social factors
that might affect offending behaviour, consider the evidence base in the area
alongside individual pathways and lived experience. You will also develop a
deeper understanding of the processes involved in the Criminal Justice System.  <br>
<br>
The course is designed to give students both a solid
understanding of mainstream Psychology and a more detailed understanding of
Forensic Psychology theory, research and practice. You will be encouraged to
critically engage with academic material, evaluate its applications and develop
an understanding of individual pathways and issues related to research and
practice in secure settings. Understanding both evidence and the experience of
those who have committed a crime will assist you in the development of your own
critical approach to professional practice and research in forensic psychology. <br>
<br>
A degree in forensic psychology will help you build a career in organisations
such as the Prison Service, the Probation, Youth Offending teams, substance use
and secure mental health services.<br>
<br>
It will also put you in a good position to apply for the specialised
postgraduate training needed to become a practising forensic psychologist.</p>

                    <p>Do you have a passion for helping people, do you feel inspired to make a positive change in people's lives, and to meet society's ever-growing need for help in times of mental health difficulties, bereavement, or any number of life's troubles? Then our undergraduate Counselling course is for you. </p>
<p>Our course integrates current therapeutic approaches in an innovative way to prepare you to become a skilled, competent and reflective practitioner. It offers you a rare opportunity to gain both a BACP-accredited academic degree and a professional qualification, and through 108 hours of placements, you'll be well on your way to becoming an accredited practitioner. </p>
<p>We’ll give you in-depth knowledge of the four major psychotherapeutic approaches:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Person-centred</li>
    <li>Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)</li>
    <li>Psychodynamic</li>
    <li>Existential </li>
</ul>
<p>You will develop your understanding of the key feature of counselling – the therapeutic relationship between counsellor and client. In order to achieve this, you’ll undergo personal therapy yourself, starting in year one. You’ll also practise what you’ve learned in lectures through video-recorded counselling sessions in the UEL labs. We’ll enhance your employment prospects by offering you work placements and a number of volunteering and community action projects.</p>
<p>Study our course and you can find yourself profoundly changing people's lives in a career that will give you incredible satisfaction and reward. </p>

<p> </p>
<p class=""BodyA"">We place a strong emphasis on learning all about the body’s structure and functions, with a particular focus on anatomy, histology, biochemistry and pharmacology.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class=""BodyA"">We’ll give you a practical insight into the techniques and instrumentation used to investigate the human body in varying states of health and disease, such as fitness tests, chest X-rays and electrocardiograms (ECG), which measure the electrical activity of the heart.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class=""BodyA"">You’ll examine life support systems and have the chance to earn a first-aid qualification. You’ll also discover what happens when body systems break down and how this can lead to disease.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class=""BodyA"">You’ll have the option to take our four-year placement course, which features a year’s work experience, normally in a laboratory, after your second year. We’ve seen how such placements often lead to full-time jobs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p class=""Body"">If you don't meet the entry requirements for a BSc degree, you have the option of taking an extended four-year version of this course. You’ll begin by taking a Bioscience foundation year which will prepare you for the BSc degree.</p>

                                    If you don’t meet the entry requirements for a bachelor’s degree, you can study this course as an ‘extended’ four-year programme. You’ll begin with a foundation year, which will prepare you for a successful transition to the degree course a year later.<br>
By the end of the degree you’ll gain the same qualification as those obtaining direct entry to the course but you’ll take one year longer to complete your studies.<br>

                    <p>This is a highly practical course which combines a thorough understanding of Computer Science with a carefully supervised programme of education theory and practice – involving regular stints in schools. <br>
For two thirds of your time you will study alongside specialising Computer Science students as you learn the main areas of the subject. These include software engineering and programming languages, as well as computer systems, computer architecture and data structures.</p>
<p>In addition to the technical knowledge you’ll need to pursue a career in this field, you’ll learn about the impact of technology on individuals, organisations and society.<br>
But from your first year you will also have regular experience of working, and eventually teaching, in schools, so you will emerge ready to take up a teaching career straight away. Your progression will be carefully supported and monitored by tutors who are acutely aware of how to pace your experience. <br>

                    <p class=""BodyA"">Whether it’s investigating a type of cancer or understanding the cause of food poisoning, biomedical scientists play a crucial role in diagnosing disease and evaluating effective treatment.</p>
<p class=""BodyA"">Doctors make decisions based on the results of tests carried out by biomedical scientists in the pathology laboratory, while patients benefit from their experience and expertise. Without their skills, key hospital departments such as Accident and Emergency couldn’t operate effectively.<br>
<br>
Our course offers an in-depth understanding of the causes of disease and the practical ways in which they can be investigated in the laboratory. These are the fundamental areas of knowledge that you’ll need as a biomedical scientist.<br>
<br>
Course Leader Dr Claudio Scotti believes the popularity of the course is because it's “broad-based”. It’s ideal for students who want to make a career in bioscience but have not yet decided in exactly what area to specialise.<br>
<br>
The course, which offers extensive laboratory training, shares a common first year with other bioscience degrees, so you’ll have the option to switch to a similar degree course at the end of your first year if you wish.<br>
<br>
The course is also available with a year-long work placement between years two and three. If you choose this option, you’ll have the chance to spend your third year working in a laboratory, adding valuable practical experience to your growing academic knowledge.</p>
<p class=""BodyA"">If you don't meet the entry requirements for a BSc degree, you have the option of taking an extended, four-year version of this course. You’ll take a bioscience foundation year which will prepare you for the BSc degree.</p>

By the end of the degree you’ll gain the same qualification as those obtaining direct entry to the course but you’ll take one year longer to complete your studies.<br>

                    <p>The cyber security landscape is constantly evolving and organisations are finding it increasingly difficult to defend themselves from these constantly changing and persistent threats. It is critical that both business and government agencies protect their systems and data from potential risks arising from these threats. Because of this, there is a demand for qualified cyber security professionals.</p>
<p>Our Cyber Security and Networks degree course is an opportunity for you to develop knowledge and skills necessary to address these challenges and meet the demand. </p>
<p>The course aims to give you a fundamental understanding of how to protect organisations, networks, IT systems and individuals against cyber attacks and potential risks. </p>
<p>You will be taught by staff who are actively engaged in cyber security research and possess substantial experience of the application of security-related technologies in industry.</p>

                                    This course offers the opportunity of year-long placement between years two and three. If you choose to take this option, you’ll spend your third year on a placement with a relevant company or organisation, adding valuable practical experience to your growing academic knowledge. <br>
<br>
The extra placement year means it will take four years to complete your studies, instead of three.

                    <p>Our new BSc Chemistry course will give you an in-depth understanding of the fundamental studies of structures, properties and reactions relating to chemistry.
There is currently a high demand for chemists with strong analytical and practical skills. </p>
<p>Throughout the course you will gain these skills while covering aspects of physical, inorganic and organic chemistry. The course will also provide you with extensive laboratory training throughout all years of the course and thereby enhance your employability further.</p>
<p>
The BSc Chemistry course will provide you with rigorous training that will ensure you graduate with the skills necessary to pursue a career in chemistry or a related field.
Studying chemistry offers many employment pathways. As a UEL student you could choose to extend your degree by a year and get some hands-on experience in industry. </p>
<p>This industrial research year would give you the practical skills that employers seek, giving you a competitive edge upon graduation.
Upon completion of the BSc Chemistry you could choose to study for a PGCE in Secondary Chemistry with us.
</p>
<p>You’ll be taught by leading experts in chemistry and academia, have the chance to gain industry experience and cover several key aspects of chemistry that will open doors to numerous employment opportunities.

                                    If you don’t meet the entry requirements for a bachelor’s degree, you can study this course as an ‘extended’ four-year programme. You’ll begin with a foundation year, which will prepare you for a successful transition to the degree course a year later.<br>
By the end of the degree you’ll gain the same qualification as those obtaining direct entry to the course but you’ll take one year longer to complete your studies.<br>

                    <p>Your degree in Child Psychology will develop your knowledge and understanding of children and young people from a psychological, cognitive, social, emotional and cultural perspective.<br>
<br>
You’ll be focusing on why babies, children, adolescents and older people behave the way they do. You’ll also design and carry out studies to explore the factors that go to influence adult behaviour.<br>
<br>
The aim is to learn how psychologists can use their knowledge to understand individuals and help them to make a positive difference to their life’s development.<br>
<br>
You’ll be studying in one of the largest – and friendliest – Schools of Psychology in the country, with a huge range of expertise available to you on the campus across a range of subjects. <br>

                    <p class=""BodyA"">Pharmaceutical science is the study of the formulation, development and manufacture of new drugs. Pharmaceutical scientists have the power to transform patients’ lives by developing new treatments for diseases.</p>
<p class=""BodyA"">This new and already popular course will take you inside this complex and ever-expanding field of discovery.</p>
<p class=""BodyA"">Pharmaceutical science encompasses chemistry, biochemistry, pharmacology, toxicology and physiology. It looks at how different drugs act on the human body and how their healing effects can be safely used.</p>
<p>We’ll introduce you to a diverse selection of subjects to help you gain an insight into the development, design, delivery and use of new drugs. This thorough background will ensure that a wide range of career choices will be open to you when you graduate.<br>
<br>
You’ll be entitled to become a student member of the Academy of Pharmaceutical Sciences (APS), the professional body for Pharmaceutical Sciences in the UK.<br>
<br>
This course offers the opportunity of year-long work placement between years two and three. If you choose to take this option, you’ll spend your third year working in the pharmaceutical industry, adding valuable practical experience to your growing academic knowledge.</p>
<p>The first year of this course is shared with other Biosciences degrees at UEL, giving you maximum flexibility if you decide to transfer to a different course for years two and three.</p>

                    <p>Rail and rail systems engineering at the University of East
London is designed to meet the increasing demand (national and international)
for transport engineering professionals requiring technical skills in
sustainable, integrated and intelligent rail infrastructure and rail
systems.  <br>
<br>
Graduates of the programme will be able to design, build,
operate and manage the sophisticated and complex interfaces
characterising existing and new railways and infrastructure. The programme will
also enable you to gain strong theoretical knowledge and practical skills in
civil and systems engineering with a core focus on the railway industry and its
operations. You will be actively involved in developing the specific design and
professional skills required by professional engineers and will tackle numerous
design problems to develop your interpersonal, enterprise and employability
skillset (aka mental wealth) along with analytical, technical and industrial
decision-making abilities.  <br>
<br>
Whilst studying all the major civil, mechanical and systems
engineering subjects, you will also gain experience in a range of current
railway system issues and disciplines. The programme will benefit from the
opportunities to get involved in cutting edge research projects on built environment
of infrastructure, geotechnics, coastal and transportation engineering.  <br>
<br>
The programme also offers an optional placement
year to all students, enabling you to experience the real world and effectively
connect your UEL experience with the industry.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>We have great links with industry and high levels of graduate employment. You’ll enjoy regular visits to iconic construction sites in London as well as professionally monitored field study courses and projects.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Entry level is 96 UCAS points, and you don’t need A2 maths. You’ll take a top-up module in your first year that will underpin and extend your GCSE maths knowledge.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You can also gain advanced entry on to the final year of this BSc course by completing our two-year Foundation degree in civil engineering.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This makes our course ideal for students who, while not necessarily ‘maths geniuses’, nevertheless have good basic skills in that area and aspirations to develop a career in management or a range of technical fields.</p>

<p>If you want to be out there in the real world, learning and researching and making a difference, this is the course for you.</p>
<p>You’ll practise what you are learning through partnerships or voluntary schemes within local community groups or the NHS.</p>
<p>You’ll widen your experience and learn new skills, such as evidence-based evaluations, report writing and making recommendations for practice. </p>
<p>In at least one of your modules you have the opportunity to undertake a professional piece of evidence-based research for a community partner – a service that the organisation would perhaps not otherwise have been able to afford.</p>

                    <p>Architectural Design Technology is an interdisciplinary course that blends architecture with building engineering, building technology and construction management. Our team of architects, architectural technologists, and engineers will equip you with all the skills and knowledge you need for a rewarding career in this growing field. You will benefit from the contribution of architects and professionals from world-renown<a href=""http://www.uel.ac.uk""> </a>practices such as Foster and Partners, Zaha Hadid Architects, Make Architects, SOM, Rogers Stirk Harbour, ARUP, and Atkins. </p>
<p>The programme can be studied in either full-time (3 years or 4 years if you choose to do a placement year) or part-time mode (6 years). Apprenticeship routes have also been introduced in 16/17, in which employers within the construction sector have approached the University to offer Construction Design Management as an apprenticeship route on a part-time basis.<a href=""/-/media/olive-course/olive-2-presentations/enar-presentation--uel-olive-courses-0212--0412.ashx?la=en&amp;hash=D4A063D66644C974929E27A3175EE7587A6CEA89""></a><a href=""/-/media/main/images/course-year-books-2020/bsc_and_march_architecture_96dpi_spreads_with_cover.ashx?la=en&amp;hash=D720540C1233E26E387A4882A68EF6C5DE95CA8E"">Download our yearbook to see our former students' work</a></p>
<p>The course has a strong grounding in design projects and is particularly recognisable by its ‘hands-on’ approach to architectural design. There is a strong focus on technical studies as well as computer software for Computer Aided Drawing (AutoCAD, Revit, BIM, Adobe Illustrator, Rhino), and building design and energy performance simulations (Integrated Environmental Solutions (IES), and Design Builder). We have world class laboratories and workshops including digital and robotic manufacture (laser cutters, 3D printers, robotic arm). </p>

                                    This course offers the opportunity of year-long placement between years two and three. If you choose to take this option, you’ll spend your third year on a placement with a relevant company or organisation, adding valuable practical experience to your growing academic knowledge. <br>
<br>
The extra placement year means it will take four years to complete your studies, instead of three.

                    <p>There are so many aspects to construction management – organising resources, materials, labour, and planning transport routes. Ensuring that a building project runs smoothly, with enough materials, equipment, workers and money to deliver it, is a huge task. So, too, is monitoring construction quality and progress.</p>
<p>This course will give you the knowledge, skills and understanding as well as industry contacts to help you develop into that role and to take on that kind of responsibility.  It is also accredited by the Chartered Institute of Building (CIOB) and fits within their educational framework for professional membership.  </p>
<p>Key areas you will study include the planning and financing of projects, required contract law and of course health and safety knowledge – both for yourself and others. Time planning and logistics, cost control and management, and quality control are vital skills for a construction manager, and they are skills we will help you to gain through problem solving, digital collaborative working as well as traditional team work activities.</p>
<p>This course can also be studied part-time day release as independent study or as a sponsored student on a Degree Apprenticeship programme for Site Construction Management.<br>

                                    This course offers the opportunity of year-long placement between years two and three. If you choose to take this option, you’ll spend your third year on a placement with a relevant company or organisation, adding valuable practical experience to your growing academic knowledge. <br>
<br>
The extra placement year means it will take four years to complete your studies, instead of three.

                    <p>Whether it’s the fun of Super Mario or the horror of Resident Evil that consumes you, this is your chance to convert your passion for playing games into knowledge about how to create and design them.</p>
<p>
You’ll get the most out of our course if you come with an interest in all kinds of games – board, card and pen-and-paper - not just digital ones. You’ll be amazed what you can learn from games like Munchkin or Dungeons and Dragons.</p>
<p>We run two games courses at UEL, subtly different but both sharing the same focus on designing games and game play.</p>
Our course will equip you, like many of our successful graduates, for a role in the expanding games industry.
We're justly proud of the imagination and quality of our students’ work.
<p>By the end of your course, you should be playing a game you designed yourself – and hopefully following in the footsteps of the many UEL graduates now making their mark in the games industry.</p>

                                    This course offers the opportunity of year-long placement between years two and three. If you choose to take this option, you’ll spend your third year on a placement with a relevant company or organisation, adding valuable practical experience to your growing academic knowledge. <br>
<br>
The extra placement year means it will take four years to complete your studies, instead of three.

<p>We take a hands-on approach, so you can expect us to push your creativity. Throughout the course, you’ll focus on the process of making, and then reflect on what you’ve designed to boost your technical knowledge.You’ll develop the skills all architects need, including drawing, model making and using computer-aided design.</p>
<p>In the lecture theatre, you’ll cover history, theory, technology and computing. To give you the support you need, our experienced tutors will run sessions with you individually or in a small group. </p>
<p>Throughout the course, you’ll develop your own creative style, and put together your own portfolio to showcase your talents to potential employers after you graduate. The core of architecture is the design studio, and the main emphasis of our course is developing your design ability. Since our key aim is to push your creativity and judgment to the maximum, you can expect the course to be highly demanding.</p>

                                    This course offers the opportunity of year-long placement between years two and three. If you choose to take this option, you’ll spend your third year on a placement with a relevant company or organisation, adding valuable practical experience to your growing academic knowledge. <br>
<br>
The extra placement year means it will take four years to complete your studies, instead of three.

Our unique teaching approach aims to promote Learning by Doing through guiding you to use observational, prototyping and physical simulation methods in design, in addition to teaching you the theories, engineering principles and standards. You will be encouraged to be creative, innovative and to use advanced digital tools to shape your imaginations and translate them to specifications for structures and systems that you design. For example, in your final year modules, you will not only designing structures from foundation to roof, but you will also use a suite of software and 3D manufacturing suites including 3D printers, plasma and laser cutting machines, robotic arm and clay printer as tools to bring your design into scaled realty. <br>
<br>
As well as completing numerous practical projects, you’ll benefit from visits by top professionals who’ll offer you advice – and, often, work opportunities.</p>
<p>Our Docklands campus is ideally situated for studying iconic projects in the capital such as the Tate Modern Phase 2 Extension, the Canary Wharf Crossrail Station and the reconfiguration of the Olympic Stadium.<br>

                    How is the 4th Industrial revolution going to affect the skills you’ll need to get a graduate level job? Why has the Covid-19 pandemic seen more deaths amongst people from ‘BAME’ communities? How can communities organise more effectively to challenge social inequalities? What will the ‘new normal’ look like and how will this address the global environmental crisis? <br>
<br>
Studying questions like these on the BA (Hons) Sociology degree will develop your digital sociological imagination and the critical and professional skills that lead on to a wide range of careers such as teaching, social research, journalism, social work, human resources, social policy and NGO management. <br>
<br>
Your first two years on the degree will prepare you to conduct your own research project on a subject of your own choice supervised by one of your lecturers and you will also gain valuable work experience by doing a work placement in your final year. <br>

                                    If you don’t meet the entry requirements for a bachelor’s degree, you can study this course as an ‘extended’ four-year programme. You’ll begin with a foundation year, which will prepare you for a successful transition to the degree course a year later.<br>
<br>
By the end of the degree you’ll gain the same qualification as those obtaining direct entry to the course but you’ll take one year longer to complete your studies. <br>

                    <p>Are you interested in how people develop and what influences their behaviour? Do you want to help people at risk of harm? Are you interested in legislation and social policy?</p>
<p>
This hugely popular course, one of UEL’s flagship degrees, will give you a rewarding insight into contemporary social work and train you to become a reflective, capable and effective practitioner. You’ll learn how to support, protect and speak up for people in significant personal difficulty.</p>
<p>
We’ll give you the theory and information you need through lectures and seminars, but this course is all about hands-on experience – or ‘learning by doing’, as we call it.</p>
<p>
You’ll undertake supervised placements in your second and third years, applying your learning by working on real-life projects. By doing this, you’ll be able to narrow down your areas of interest for your post-university career.</p>
<p>
Thanks to an accreditation agreement between the University of East London and the Health and Care Professions Council, your degree will allow you to practise as a qualified social worker immediately after you graduate. </p>

                    <p>Psychosocial Studies derived out of a desire to develop a programme in the Social Sciences that enables us to think about individuals' lived experiences not just from a psychological perspective or a sociological one but in a much more holistic way. Society shapes the way that individuals experience their worlds and, in turn, our inner worlds influence our thoughts, actions and relationships. The two facets are dynamically and intimately related to each other and to focus upon just one aspect severely limits our perspectives of human beings. To become a professional community practitioner, one needs not only a theoretical and ethical understanding of people's personal motivations, circumstances, beliefs, backgrounds, behaviours, cultures etc, but one also needs to critically consider the societal structures and systems that impact lives.<br>
<br>
If you don’t meet the entry requirements for a BA, you can study this course as an ‘extended’ four-year programme. You'll begin with a Social Science Foundation year which will prepare you for a successful transition to the BA degree.<br>

                    <p>Can you imagine a world without photographs? <br>
<br>
We are looking for a new generation of photographers who understand how photography shapes the world and want to know how to push the boundaries, explore new processes and use their knowledge to work for change.<br>
<br>
We will support you to gain advanced skills in photographic production, while developing a sophisticated understanding of the historical and contemporary uses of photography.<br>
<br>
As part of the unique Art and Design Cluster, you will have opportunities to collaborate on inter-disciplinary projects, preparing you to engage in a competitive job market equipped with skills for the fourth industrial age (4iR). <br>
<br>
You will develop a professional photography portfolio reflecting both your specific interests and your career aspirations whilst gaining confidence in a wide range of creative practices from medium/large format cameras, self-publishing, audio and moving image production to e.g. 3D fabrication. You will also have access to one of the largest darkrooms in London to explore analogue photography. </p>

With our innovative Politics and International Relations course we can equip you with the skills and knowledge to play an active role in this new world. </p>

                    <p>If you enjoy creating images, making things, inventing stories and working on projects with like-minded people, then we have the ideal course for you. This has an extremely broad remit, from editorial publishing through to the guerrilla activists of street art, from book and magazine cover design to zines and graphic novels.</p>
<p>The course has its own very distinct flavour because it’s not directed at or bound by the conventions of industry. We want you to give full vent to your creativity and explore all sorts of areas where your illustration skills could be used. You’ll have opportunities to take part in leading illustration competitions that will showcase your work to the professional world. </p>
<p>You’ll be taught by professional artists and designers and have access to the best facilities in our superbly equipped workshops. East London is one of the most vibrantly creative areas in Europe, close to the established cultural hub of central London and the exciting new one in Stratford.</p>
<p>We have outstanding book and journal-making equipment, a printmaking workshop, a wood and 3D workshop, plaster and casting workshops as well as a fully equipped Mac lab and 3D laser cutting gear.</p>

                    <p>This undergraduate course is designed for students who are committed to becoming primary school teachers. In only three years, you will gain a BA (Hons) degree and Qualified Teacher Status. Your degree will focus on children’s rights, values and learning.</p>
<p>
This course trains you to teach the three to seven age range, but this will not restrict you to working with this age group. You will study pedagogy and subject knowledge covering both the Early Years Foundation Stage and National Curriculum.  East London offers multicultural, multilingual and vibrant schools in which to learn, but your training at UEL will qualify you to teach anywhere in England or Wales.</p>
UEL’s Primary Education with QTS team is made up of experienced practitioners and researchers, who research a range of childhood issues and who have diverse experience in Primary and Early Years education.  <br>
<br>
With high graduate employability, this qualification provides a wide range of opportunities for career development across the primary education sector. <br>

<p>Are you interested in how deviance in social circumstances can lead to crime? Are you fascinated by social justice, human rights and the workings of the criminal justice system?
</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""line-height: 150%;"">On this course, you’ll study these issues in the vibrant, multicultural setting of east London. You’ll graduate with a degree that has vocational relevance, while putting no limit on your career options.</p>

                    <p>Our course will give you the educational and creative framework – and the necessary contacts – to launch you on your path to becoming an interior designer.</p>
<p>From the outset, you’ll set about amassing a huge range of skills, including drawing, photography, model-making, measuring and documenting spaces and buildings.</p>
<p>You’ll study design in all its forms – architectural, commercial and retail, residential, furniture, set and exhibition designs. Much of the work will be done on your feet as you visit local sites and examine their features.</p>
<p>You’ll enjoy frequent visits to the rich cultural array of galleries, shops and museums on our doorstep in London.</p>

<p>We have excellent links with the local community, and our students spend a lot of time developing design ideas for specific projects such as restoring historical sites in the East End, or designing a new café. </p>

                    <p>Are you interested in finding out how social development is affecting the people who live in the world’s poorest countries? Do you want to learn about globalisation and consider its impact on the people of Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean, the Middle East and Europe?  Are you interested in the way NGOs work to address issues of poverty? Do you worry about the value of their work?</p>
<p>This course will give you the answers you seek – and much more. There has never been a more pressing time to study International Development with NGO Management. Globalisation continues to impact the world’s poorest countries in the global South, and the reaction to globalisation  continues to manifest itself in the global North through Brexit and the election of populist leaders. Conflict, climate change, Covid-19 and humanitarian crises all demand a response from the world. </p>
<p>Our course equips you to find your place in this response. You will acquire the skills and knowledge to research and analyse complex problems, to develop your own and ideas and plans for a development project and how to fundraise for it, and ultimately to find a career that will give you job-satisfaction – being part of changing the world for the better<br>
<br>
We use textbooks and real-world experience, encouraging you to step outside the classroom and study beyond the headlines. We offer you the chance to gain valuable work experience in an NGO, such as Save the Children UK or Otra Cosa (Peru), as a core part of your course. </p>

                    <p>With an industry looking towards the future of textiles, we consider all aspects of theory and design that drive the innovation of textiles such as the political, economic, social, technological, environmental and legal climate that will shape our students thinking towards being future pioneers of tomorrow’s world. <br>
<br>
Textiles at UEL seeks to go beyond the surface of well used methods such as print and surface design and encourages our students to look towards the future with new and exciting digital processes and back again at the innovative fabrications of heritage crafts from the past. The course aims to provide you with a rich learning experience in applied textiles, which will focus on highly creative design solutions for fashion, interiors and the home.  <br>
<br>
You will have the opportunity to embrace fashion and textile futures, new materials and technical innovations in the production of innovative applied textiles across all mediums. In addition, sustainability and ethics are at the heart of all the modules you will study.</p>

                                    This course offers the opportunity of year-long placement between years two and three. If you choose to take this option, you’ll spend your third year on a placement with a relevant company or organisation, adding valuable practical experience to your growing academic knowledge. <br>
<br>
The extra placement year means it will take four years to complete your studies, instead of three.<br>

                    In a time of emerging automation and artificial intelligence
it will be the designers, the thinkers and the problem solvers who will shape
the world to come. Being agile, multi-skilled and adaptable will be key to employability in a global and dynamic
job market.<br>
<br>
BA Graphic Design at UEL combines the study of traditional
visual communication with the possibilities of emerging technologies. We provide the forum and facilities
(link) in which staff and industry expertise fuse with students’ own knowledge,
experience and ambition. We explore both practical and theoretical
understanding and, from the outset, we encourage students to think
experimentally and evolve our field.<br>
<br>
This course operates within the <a href=""/subjects/subject-areas/art-and-creative-design"">Art and Creative Design subject</a>. This allows students to work collaboratively, broadening their
knowledge base while forging a creative community. Cluster-wide workshops allow
our students to build a unique portfolio of skills essential to the <a href=""http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Globalization_4.0_Call_for_Engagement.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Fourth Industrial Age</a>.

                    <p>They say that fashion demands an eye for style. If that’s the case, fashion marketing demands one eye on style, one on hard business and at least two more in the back of your head!</p>
<p>Others may create the garment but it is you, the creative marketer, the skilful strategist, who will turn it into the must-have, must-wear commodity. You may not be the creator but what we’ll teach you on our new Fashion Marketing course is an art in its own right.</p>
<p>We’ll teach you how to retail, brand and merchandise fashion. You’ll discover promotional and sales strategies, learning how to take a new fashion product from the concept stage all the way to the high street store.</p>
<p>You’ll do this in close collaboration with your fashion design and fashion textiles student colleagues at UEL. This is crucial for you to gain the clearest, broadest picture of an industry that, as marketers, you’ll need to understand inside out.</p>

                    <p><strong>*This course is subject to validation</strong></p>
<p>Our Fashion Studies Top-Up allows students with a
diploma in a fashion subject, or other relevant areas to study for a BA (Hons)
in Fashion Studies. It provides skills in fashion business, opportunities to create a fashion
portfolio and the option of either taking a creative or business approach to
your final major project.
</p>
<p>Fashion at University of East London has innovation and enterprise at its heart.
Together with industry partners, we seek to improve upon and challenge the
current fashion offering with bold, influential students who will be the design
leaders of tomorrow.  With a shortage of
skills across many diverse avenues within fashion, course will
fill the gap in these new risen markets, preparing prospective students towards
a more viable, and creative future. <br>
<br>
Our focus will be on the implementation of career-focused
skills, industry knowledge, technical and creative skills in making and
engineering and, notwithstanding, the guided learning through more sustainable
and ethical design for today’s fashion climate.  Emphasis on integrating digital innovation and promotion will be a
continuous addition in the teaching across most if not all modules. <br>
<br>
Our BA Fashion Studies degree is
developed in response to research by the British Fashion Council (2016) and the
National Careers Service (2016) that the fashion industry in an increasingly
global economy needs more graduates with relevant entrepreneurial and
transferable skills. The provision also recognises the skills needed by
overseas students seeking career progression in the international fashion
sector.</p>

                    <p>The Fashion industry is a multi-billion-dollar enterprise
that has a huge impact on our world today.</p>
<p>The benefits are vast and with a great industry giant such
as fashion, comes also a great need for innovators who will think above and
beyond the structural norms that has followed fashion through time, and seeks
new inspiration and change.<br>
<br>
At UEL, we pride ourselves in teaching our students to
understand the historical context of the creative industries so that they can rise
to become innovators and disruptors for the greater advancement of fashion
itself.<br>
<br>
With an eye on sustainability, ethical materials and
cultural awareness and diversity in our and the greater society of fashion,
students can become designers of influence and fledging stars in a highly
saturated market.<br>
<br>
UEL encourages students to be different and harness their
own creative diversity with tools that’ll prepare them for the wider industry
and knowledge of how they can progress on their journey.<br>
<br>
This is a fast paced, hands on course amid the creative hub
of East London, preparing students to take their place in the world of fashion.  </p>

For instance, going back to the discovery of clear glass which was created by artists then appropriated by science and engineers to make the early instruments of chemistry, art plays its role in shaping the world around us. As an advanced society it’s important we explore and experiment with all technology. What’s more, as artists, we should look for new and original ways to communicate and interact with the new knowledge gained from exploring new technologies. <br>

                    <p><strong>*This course is subject to validation.</strong></p>
<p>BA (Hons) Fashion Culture and Business is a communication and humanities orientated course that will deliver a curriculum based on the growing emergence of social responsibility within the industry of fashion. Fashion communication is evolving. The industry is now under pressure to produce ‘proactive advocates of diversity and inclusivity’ (State of Fashion 2020). The course will cater for the need to train communication literate professionals who command an understanding of empathy towards a variety of global audiences.</p>
<p>This course aims to provide you with a pedagogical structure that facilitates the learning of research methodologies, both qualitative and quantitative. You will be required to engage with communities, locally, nationally and internationally in order to produce outcomes that focus on the analysis of socio-economic and geographic phenomena relevant to the industry of fashion. </p>
<p>
The course will offer you the opportunity to work closely with other students within the University of East London’s Fashion cluster and other departments within the School of Arts and Digital Industries. </p>
<p>The course will also focus on the utilisation of the University of East London’s rich background in diverse student cohort by conducting research practice that engages with both active students and potentially, alumni, whilst following the University’s protocols on ethics in research. </p>
<p>
Digital media outcomes will be a focus for the course, concentrating on the development and refinement of visual diaries, reports and presentations.</p>
<p>
The course will work with local communities directly within the borough of Newham via organisations such as Spotlight and the Eastside Youth centre.</p>

                    <p>Some courses teach you about film-making while others concentrate on the theory and history of film. At UEL, we’ll give you a thorough, expert grounding in both.</p>
<p>We combine theory and practice, teaching you not just how to make films and videos but throwing you into every aspect of the film world, from screenwriting to cinema history.</p>
<p>Each year, you’ll make your own films, from fiction to documentaries. And in your last year, your final piece of work will be screened at a special show at a London cinema, attended by film industry executives.</p>
<p>Throughout your course, you’ll get the opportunity to develop your production skills by studying modules focused on documentary, fiction, screenwriting and avant-garde filmmaking.</p>
<p>We’ll give you the skills to work in all film-related fields. Our graduates have gone into a variety of rewarding careers, from film production to festival administration to film journalism.</p>
<p>If you don’t meet the entry requirements for a BA, you have the option of taking an ‘extended’ version of this course. </p>
<p>You’ll begin with a foundation year that will prepare you for the BA course, giving you the academic and personal skills you need for successful degree-level study.</p>

                    <p>NSS 2019 results are in! Our course achieved an amazing 100% Student Satisfaction! Our BA (Hons) Drama, Applied Theatre and Performance is an innovative degree programme that combines a commitment to socially-engaged performance practice with contemporary theatre as well as the processes of making performance for and with specific audiences. We offer exceptional opportunities for work-based learning through our network of leading industry partners. Our practice-based curriculum enables our students to thrive as creative performance-makers and applied theatre practitioners.<br>
<br>
On our programme you will gain high level skills in facilitation, devising, performance and production enabling you to act across disciplinary fields of cultural work. You also develop strong academic foundations that equip you to question, analyse and understand the cultural and ethical contexts you work in. We are passionate about your creativity and imaginative potential of our students and their ability to transform the cultural landscape of the future.<br>
<br>
‘Applied Theatre’ uses drama and performance to connect with communities that may have been marginalised. It devises theatre with, for and by its audience enabling participation and opening up the arts to the entire communities. Examples of practice include theatre in prisons, in schools, and in hospitals, as well as with specific groups such as the homeless, older people, or disabled people. Right from the outset of the degree you will be making performances and workshops in real social contexts touring your work to reach new audiences and build your facilitation skills.</p>
<p>Some of our industry partners include the Royal Court Theatre, Young Vic Theatre, Gideon Reeling, Creative Access, Kingsford Community School, School 21, Duckie, Access All Areas, Theatre Royal Stratford East, Stratford Circus, Clean Break, Brolly Prods, ZU UK, Half Moon Young People’s Theatre, Outside Edge Theatre, London Bubble, Unicorn Theatre, Hackney Pirates, M-SET and Magic Me.<br>
<br>
We have a thriving Study Abroad programme whereby students apply to spend a term in their second year at Columbia College, Chicago. The University’s Going Global programme funds shorter trips abroad for students to take part in training, undertake research participate in workshops, or visit theatre projects worldwide.</p>

                    <p>*This course is subject to validation</p>
<p>Studying on BA (Hons) Graphic Design and Illustration you will have freedom to explore both graphic design and illustration without the stigma of working between or within subjects, allowing you to bridge between the two and go on to develop a practice that blurs the line between the two — a key characteristic that has become more common in industry.
</p>
<p>You will be able to develop an original, individual approach to creating graphic design and illustration, coupled with a thorough understanding of the social, cultural and professional context occupied by these two disciplines.
Having skills in both areas (feet in both camps) allows a more adaptable approach to taking on work and being successful, chiming with the requirements of the Creative Industries 4.0, where discipline distinctions become increasingly irrelevant to professional life.
</p>
<p>Towards the end of the course, in the final year, you will be able to gravitate towards one or other on the named subjects as your creative voice emerges. It’s that flexibility which is the underlying selling point of this course.</p>

                    <p>Studying on the BA (Hons) Animation and Illustration course you will be able to explore and find your way within the two disciplines developing a practice which blurs the line between animation and illustration, but without the film making skills that the BA (Hons) Animation requires. </p>
<p>You will be working on analogue projects (e.g. printmaking and publishing alongside 2D drawn animation, stop-motion as well as new hybrid technologies like 3D printing) along with digital skills (e.g. digital 2D and 3D animation techniques, After Effects, Maya and become comfortable using Graphics Tablets to draw digitally). </p>
<p>Interdisciplinary collaboration with students from e.g. Fine Art Technology, Design Interaction and Photography allows you to exchange skills and to access technical support and subject expertise across disciplines giving you an edge in the competitive job market, with skills for the fourth industrial age (4iR).  <br>
<br>
You will be supported by yearly employability initiative Detour Ahead: Roadmaps for the Art and Design Industry, a week-long inter-disciplinary event offering you industry insights as well as guidance on subjects such as freelancing, copyright and tax. <br>
<br>
You will graduate with skills in both animation and illustration with an adaptable approach to taking on work and being successful in the Creative Industries 4.0, where discipline distinctions become increasingly irrelevant. </p>

There has never been a more exciting time to be a writer. The internet has changed the world, increasing the scope for writers and their work. Our course recognises and embraces these opportunities.

                    <p>If you’re interested in the problem of crime in contemporary societies, our Criminology and Criminal Justice course is for you.</p>
<p>As a criminology student you’ll investigate the nature of crime and criminality, studying society’s response through the criminal justice system. You’ll learn how societies try to control and punish crime and disorder, gaining a theoretical and practical understanding of this fascinating subject.</p>
<p>Criminology takes a social sciences approach by studying and classifying crime, and exploring theories around criminal behaviour. As well as the theory, you’ll learn how society deals with criminal behaviour by studying institutions and roles such as the police, courts, prisons and probation service.</p>
<p>The course offers a wide choice of options in your final year and you’ll be expected to undertake an independent piece of research on a relevant topic of particular interest to you.</p>

                    <p>On our popular combined course we’ll give you an expert insight into the causes and consequences of crime – and how it is dealt with by the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>You’ll gain a thorough understanding of core criminological theories, and we’ll help you develop the psychological knowledge you’ll need to apply your insights to real-world issues and problems.</p>
<p>You’ll take a social sciences approach to criminology by studying and classifying crime, and you’ll also learn how society responds to criminal behaviour by examining institutions and roles such as the police, courts, prisons and probation service.</p>
<p>In the psychology part of the course, you’ll study behaviour and its causes in biology, social contexts, mental processing and development. And you’ll use your knowledge to explore how criminal behaviour might be explained by understanding the factors that motivate people to commit crime. </p>

<p>You’ll learn how the law is made and administered and explore the inter-relationships between the law, individuals and society. </p>
<p>We give you the opportunity to build on this knowledge with a wide choice of 16 optional modules in your final year. And you’ll also have the opportunity to gain valuable experience in our acclaimed community Legal Advice Centre, working with local solicitors to provide a law clinic for the general public.</p>

Then studying for a Foundation
Degree in Montessori Pedagogy (AMI 3-6) awarded by UEL may be just the course for you! Since
the course is being offered in collaboration with the Maria Montessori Institute
you will also receive the teaching Diploma awarded by the Association
Montessori Internationale (AMI), the organisation set up by Maria Montessori
herself, to ensure the spread of authentic Montessori practice. The courses delivered by the
Maria Montessori Institute have evolved directly from those first delivered by
Maria Montessori and her son Mario between 1919 and 1951.<br>
The partnership between the
Maria Montessori Institute and UEL combines expertise in training highly valued
Montessori teachers with an outstanding reputation in teacher education and childhood studies.<br>
<br>
Montessori is a developmental
approach to education that recognises and encourages the natural curiosity of
children and their innate drive to learn. It emphasises learning by doing,
along with self-expression and collaboration. Montessori-educated children are
confident, creative and independent individuals, well-prepared for life. They
become responsible decision makers, respectful of the needs of others and their
natural environment, with a life-long love of learning.
<p>On our
course you will study in-depth Montessori pedagogy and practices for the child aged
between 3 and 6. Study includes: <br>
<br>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Montessori Child Psychology and Child Development</li>
    <li>Montessori Educational Theory and Practice including the role of the Montessori Teacher and the preparation of the Montessori environment </li>
    <li>Observation and Teaching Practice in schools run by AMI Teachers</li>
    <li>Statutory Guidance for the Early Years</li>
</ul>

                    <p>There’s probably never been a greater interest in the role that sport and exercise plays in people’s lives. This extended course is perfect if you want a degree in this area but you don’t meet the standard entry requirements. </p>
<p>
First we prepare you for your degree during the Foundation year, bringing you up to speed with academic skills and a firm grounding in the subject. Then you can go on to do the full undergraduate degree.<br>
<br>
It’s an exciting time to be involved in the sports industry. It’s growing and evolving as successive governments recognise the need for people to be active. Our course reflects this with its inclusive approach to sport and PE.<br>
<br>
We’ll ensure you’re ready to deliver physical education or work in a community setting to improve people’s lives, both during your degree and in your subsequent career.<br>
<br>
You’ll also explore ways of encouraging as many people as possible to throw themselves into sport and physical activity, particularly young people and those with disabilities.<br>
<br>
And where better to study the subject in depth than in London’s Olympic heartland and at a university which takes sport and its role in the community so seriously? </p>

You will learn outstanding and innovative advance image production skills with expert workshops and tuition. Contextual studies, professional practice (Mental Wealth) and entrepreneurial skills will be supporting your development and readiness for industry 4.0. <br>
<br>
Interdisciplinary collaborations with students from our BA Design Interaction, Graphic Design, Illustration and Animation courses or with our award-winning fashion students, architecture or urban dance students will allow you to exchange skills, technical support and subject expertise across disciplines. Collaborative and interdisciplinary practice is what we do well  and we have many examples of outstanding student projects commended by our industry contacts.  <br>
<br>
You will be encouraged to experiment and develop emerging technology such as AR/VR and eg. 3D technologies designed to give you edge in the competitive job market. We see these as future skills for fourth industrial age (4iR) in commercial photography.</p>

                    <p>The BA (Hons) Education Top Up provides the opportunity for those with sub-degree qualifications the opportunity to progress directly into the second (level 5) or final year (level 6) of the BA (Hons) Education Studies degree programme.  It provides a differentiated and flexible route, which enables individuals to gain an undergraduate Hons degree which will help them to develop the professional knowledge, skills and competencies relevant to their workplace settings.  It is suitable for those who do not have appropriate credits to enter directly onto the BA (Hons) Education Studies degree.  <br>
<br>
The programme is suitable for those who already hold existing credits from qualifications such as HNCs/HNDs, other level 4/5 vocational/technical qualifications or foundation degrees.  It would also appeal to Further Education practitioners, who hold level 5 teaching qualifications as well as those with relevant overseas qualifications.<br>
<br>
There is no PSRB or other professional accreditation attached to this programme.<br>
<br>
In addition to topping up to a relevant academic degree, the programme also enables participants to demonstrate to employers the capacity for academic, organisational or management skills to enhance career development opportunities or open up new career possibilities.<br>

                    <p>Our foundation year is perfect if you want to study for a degree in biomedical science but you don’t have the standard qualifications, if you’re not sure if this is the right degree for you or you’re coming from an extended break in education.<br>
<br>
Our foundation year modules will bring you up to speed with the needed academic skills and give you a firm grounding in the subject. After which you can stay on your chosen BSc or change to one of our other eligible BSc degrees.</p>
<p class=""BodyA"">Whether it’s investigating a type of cancer or understanding the cause of food poisoning, biomedical scientists play a crucial role in diagnosing disease and evaluating effective treatment.</p>
<p class=""BodyA"">Doctors make decisions based on the results of tests carried out by biomedical scientists in the pathology laboratory, while patients benefit from their experience and expertise. Without their skills, key hospital departments such as Accident and Emergency couldn’t operate effectively.<br>
<br>
Our course offers an in-depth understanding of the causes of disease and the practical ways in which they can be investigated in the laboratory. These are the fundamental areas of knowledge that you’ll need as a biomedical scientist.<br>
<br>
Course Leader Dr Claudio Scotti believes the popularity of the course is because it's “broad-based”. It’s ideal for students who want to make a career in bioscience but have not yet decided in exactly what area to specialise.<br>
<br>
The course, which offers extensive laboratory training, shares a common first year with other bioscience degrees, so you’ll have the option to switch to a similar degree course at the end of your first year if you wish.<br>
<br>
The course is also available with a year-long work placement between years two and three. If you choose this option, you’ll have the chance to spend your third year working in a laboratory, adding valuable practical experience to your growing academic knowledge.</p>

By the end of the degree you’ll gain the same qualification as those obtaining direct entry to the course but you’ll take one year longer to complete your studies.<br>

                    Our foundation year is perfect if you want to study for a degree in Chemistry but you don’t have the standard qualifications, if you’re not sure if this is the right degree for you or you’re coming from an extended break in education.<br>
<br>
Our foundation year modules will bring you up to speed with the needed academic skills and give you a firm grounding in the subject. After which you can stay on your chosen BSc or change to one of our other eligible BSc degrees.<br>
<br>
Our new BSc Chemistry course will give you an in-depth understanding of the fundamental studies of structures, properties and reactions relating to chemistry.<br>
<br>
There is currently a high demand for chemists with strong analytical and practical skills. Throughout the course you will gain these skills while covering aspects of physical, inorganic and organic chemistry. The course will also provide you with extensive laboratory training throughout all years of the course and thereby enhance your employability further. <br>
<br>
The BSc Chemistry course will provide you with rigorous training that will ensure you graduate with the skills necessary to pursue a career in chemistry or a related field.<br>
<br>
Studying chemistry offers many employment pathways. As a UEL student you could choose to extend your degree by a year and get some hands-on experience in industry. This industrial research year would give you the practical skills that employers seek, giving you a competitive edge upon graduation.<br>
<br>
Upon completion of the BSc Chemistry you could choose to study for a PGCE in Secondary Chemistry with us. You’ll be taught by leading experts in chemistry and academia, have the chance to gain industry experience and cover several key aspects of chemistry that will open doors to numerous employment opportunities.<br>
<br>
We have applied for accreditation by the Royal Society of Chemistry and aim to have the accreditation validated by the end of your degree.<br>

                    <p>Whether it’s the fun of Super Mario or the horror of Resident Evil that consumes you, this is your chance to convert your passion for playing games into knowledge about how to create and design them.</p>
<p>You’ll get the most out of our course if you come with an interest in all kinds of games – board, card and pen-and-paper - not just digital ones. You’ll be amazed what you can learn from games like Munchkin or Dungeons and Dragons.</p>
<p>We run two games courses at UEL, subtly different but both sharing the same focus on designing games and game play.</p>
<p>
Our course will equip you, like many of our successful graduates, for a role in the expanding games industry.  We're justly proud of the imagination and quality of our students’ work. By the end of your course, you should be playing a game you designed and developed yourself – and hopefully following in the footsteps of the many UEL graduates now making their mark in the games industry. </p>

If you choose to take this option, you’ll spend your third year on a placement with a relevant company or organisation, adding valuable practical experience to your growing academic knowledge. <br>
<br>
The extra placement year means it will take four years to complete your studies, instead of three.<br>

                    <p>This four-year course is perfect if you want a degree in Architecture, but don’t have the standard qualifications. We prepare you for your degree during your Foundation year, bringing you up to speed with academic skills and a firm grounding in advertising. Then you can go on to do the full undergraduate degree.</p>
<p>Our architecture course is one of our flagship degrees at the University of East London, providing you with an excellent educational framework - and the first qualification you need to become a practising architect.<br>
<br>
We’ll teach you individually or in small groups, each led by a design tutor who is usually a practising architect. Our team of academics will also support you in areas of history, theory, technology and computing.<br>
<br>
We take a distinctly ‘hands-on’ approach to architecture. Our course emphasises learning through the process of making, and then reflecting critically on what has been made, developing your creativity and your critical judgement.</p>
<p><a href=""/-/media/main/images/course-year-books-2020/foundation_96dpi_spreads_with_cover.ashx?la=en&amp;hash=B6E660B8A13D0C4683DCB057DC0D9A0AD9D1DDA7""><strong>Download our year book</strong></a> to view examples of our students' work.</p>
<br>
Our driving forces are imagination, investigation, experimentation and innovation, and you’ll explore a wide variety of approaches, interests and areas of work.<br>
<br>
The core of architecture is the design studio, and the main emphasis of our course is developing your design ability. Since our key aim is to push your creativity and judgment to the maximum, you can expect the course to be highly demanding.

                    <div>This extended course is perfect if you want a degree in Civil Engineering but you don’t have the standard entry requirements. 
<div>
First we prepare you for your degree during your Foundation year, bringing you up to speed with academic skills and a firm grounding in the subject. </div>
<div>
Then you can go on to do the full undergraduate degree, which is a three-year course. You also have the option of adding a year-long placement working in the industry. Your degree is accredited by the Joint Board of Moderators.</div>
<div>
As well as completing numerous practical projects, you’ll benefit from visits from top professionals who’ll offer you advice – and, often, work opportunities.</div>

The extra placement year means it will take four years to complete your studies, instead of three.

                    <p>Criminology and Law are a perfect fit, combining a social science approach to crime with an understanding of core legal principles and institutions.</p>
<p>You’ll learn about the causes and consequences of crime through a study of the current theories, issues and debates, backed by an understanding of the criminal justice system and its institutions and roles such as the police, courts, prisons and probation service.</p>
<p>And you’ll explore the inter-relationships between the law, individuals and society, studying how the law fits into the social, political and cultural context of the society we live in.</p>
<p>You should note that this very popular course does not provide exemption from the academic stage of qualifying as a solicitor or barrister. Please see our LLB (Hons) Law with Criminology if this interests you. </p>

                    <div>Have you ever dreamed of being a sports writer? This extended course is perfect if you want a degree in Sports Journalism but you don’t meet the standard entry requirements. </div>
<div> 
<p>First we prepare you for your degree during the foundation year, bringing you up to speed with academic skills and a firm grounding in the subject. Then you can go on to do the full undergraduate degree.</p>
<p>Our course offers an exciting but practical, hands-on approach to learning how to report on sport. By the time you finish your degree, you’ll be fully trained as a multi-platform journalist, ready to write for newspapers, magazines, radio, television, the internet and mobile apps. </p>
<p>During our course, you could end up interviewing the England cricket captain. Or reporting on a Football League match. Or being taken on a tour of Wembley or Sky Studios. Or, here in London’s Olympic heartland, writing a feature from the University of East London's £21 million SportsDock facility for our website, Rising East.</p>
<p>Guided by expert lecturers and tutors who are all working sports journalists, we aim to develop your passion and knowledge of sport so that you can deliver and share it with others.</p>

                    <p>Our public health degree is an interdisciplinary programme, which broadens students’ horizons to explore health needs and the links between theory and practice in relation to the concepts and principles of public health.
<br>
<br>
A degree in public health is one that will equip you with skills and knowledge to improve and protect public health and the well-being of individuals, communities and populations. You will focus on how to tackle major health challenges and reduce inequalities at global, national and local levels. This degree aims to boost your chances of employability in the field of epidemiology, statistical analysis, public health training, public and social care, community health, and health care services.
<br>
<br>
You will be encouraged to take on a work placement so you can gain professional and practical skills through working with a local authority, social entity or an NGO. Working on one aspect of public health would help you contribute in improving healthcare service delivery, empowering people in building a healthy lifestyle and influencing health policy reform in London and beyond.</p>

                    <p>This extended course is perfect if you want a degree in sociology, but don’t meet the standard entry requirements. 
</p>
<div>How is the 4th industrial revolution going to affect the skills you’ll need to get a graduate level job? Why has the Covid-19 pandemic seen more deaths amongst people from ‘BAME’ communities? How can communities organise more effectively to challenge social inequalities? What will the ‘new normal’ look like and how will this address the global environmental crisis? <br>
<br>
Studying questions like these on the BA (Hons) Sociology degree will develop your digital sociological imagination and the critical and professional skills that lead on to a wide range of careers such as teaching, social research, journalism, social work, human resources, social policy and NGO management. <br>
<br>
The foundation year will prepare your academic skills and understanding of the subject area. Following this you will learn the skills to conduct your own research project on a subject of your own choice. This will be supervised by one of your lecturers. You will also gain valuable work experience by doing a work placement in your final year. <br>

The course is a practical one, designed to excite and challenge at the same time as it teaches you. </div>
<div><br>
Affiliated to the Association of Photographers, the leading organisation representing professionals in the industry, our course will arm you with the skills to make a living from photography.</div>
<div><br>
It's no coincidence that our graduates have so often gone on to successful careers, establishing highly successful studios or being assistants to the best in the industry.</div>
<div><br>

                    First we prepare you for your degree during the Foundation year, bringing you up to speed with academic skills and a firm grounding in the subject. Then you can go on to do the full undergraduate degree.<br>
<br>
Mechanical engineering involves the design and production of almost any machinery or operation of systems such as medical implant devices, aeroplanes, space vehicle systems, cars, robots, sports equipment and power stations. This includes the use of thermal, fluid, solid, finite methods, computer-aided design, simulation, energy, mechatronics, materials and manufacturing methods. It will enable you to use your skills in almost any engineering sector.<br>
<br>
Our course has been carefully designed by experts in the field to prepare students for professional practice in the world of interdisciplinary technology.<br>
<br>
The course provides you with analytical and scientific knowledge and management skills to design and manufacture complex mechanical systems. You’ll develop problem-solving expertise by creating practical solutions to problems that are directly relevant to industrial needs.<br>
<br>
The course emphasises industry-standard modelling and simulation techniques such as CFD and FEA, as you establish the specification, design and analysis of mechanical engineering systems.<br>
<br>
You'll have access to the very latest equipment and resources to carry out this work. All of which will equip you for a wide range of future careers.<br>
<br>
During your course, you’ll have regular contact with blue chip companies and industry leaders in the sector, who will host visits and work placements and provide regular guest speakers to the University of East London.<br>
<br>
We are currently seeking accreditation for our courses from professional institutions, IET and IMechE. This degree will provide you with the BEng level underpinning knowledge, understanding and skills for eventual registration as a Chartered Engineer (CEng)<br>

                    <p>If you love sport and want to help others get the most out of their abilities and talents, then this course is ideal for you. It’s perfect if you want a degree in this area but you don’t meet the standard entry requirements. <br>
<br>
In your Foundation Year, you will study the fundamental skills and knowledge needed for you to achieve success on your degree. You will study alongside Foundation Year students from all our Sports courses and learn from our dedicated team of sports academics. At the end of the year, you will even have the chance to progress on to a different sports degree if you wish.</p>
<p>We are making swift strides towards our aim of becoming London’s number one university for sport. This extended course is perfect if you want a degree in Sport and Exercise Science but you don’t meet the standard entry requirements. </p>
<p>
First we prepare you for your degree during the Foundation year, bringing you up to speed with academic skills and a firm grounding in the subject. Then you can go on to do the full undergraduate degree.<br>
<br>
On the BSc course you’ll be examining the role that biomechanics, physiology, psychology and nutrition play in human performance. You’ll also look at how these disciplines interact, so you receive the complete education a multi-disciplinary sports scientist needs.<br>
<br>
You will have the chance to study optional subjects that give our course its special flavour – such as our module in disability sport.<br>
<br>
It is a course that has attracted some of Britain’s leading sportsmen and women of the day such as European 200m champion Adam Gemili, Commonwealth 200m bronze medallist Bianca Williams and double European and Commonwealth medal-winning swimmer Aimee Willmott. It also develops the sports scientists and teachers who’ll help deliver the champions of tomorrow.<br>
<br>
If you want to know how good our course is, don’t just take our word for it. Listen to Adam:<br>
<br>
""As an athlete you need to understand how your body works - the biomechanics,"" he says. ""That knowledge has really helped me when I’m in the blocks to get the biggest first step that I can.""</p>

                    <div>This extended course is perfect if you want a degree in Interior Design but you don’t meet the standard entry requirements. </div>
<p>First we prepare you for your degree during the Foundation year, bringing you up to speed with academic skills and a firm grounding in the subject. Then you can go on to do the full undergraduate degree.</p>
<p>Our course will give you the educational and creative framework – and the necessary contacts – to launch you on your path to becoming an interior designer.</p>
<p>From the outset, you’ll set about amassing a huge range of skills, including drawing, photography, model-making, measuring and documenting spaces and buildings.</p>
<p>You’ll study design in all its forms – architectural, commercial and retail, residential, furniture, set and exhibition designs. Much of the work will be done on your feet as you visit local sites and examine their features.</p>
<p>You’ll enjoy frequent visits to the rich cultural array of galleries, shops and museums on our doorstep in London.</p>

                    <p><strong>*This course is subject to validation</strong></p>
<p>Psychosocial Studies derived out of a desire to develop a programme in the Social Sciences that enables us to think about individuals' lived experiences not just from a psychological perspective or a sociological one but in a much more holistic way. Society shapes the way that individuals experience their worlds and, in turn, our inner worlds influence our thoughts, actions and relationships. The two facets are dynamically and intimately related to each other and to focus upon just one aspect severely limits our perspectives of human beings. To become a professional community practitioner, one needs not only a theoretical and ethical understanding of people's personal motivations, circumstances, beliefs, backgrounds, behaviours, cultures etc, but one also needs to critically consider the societal structures and systems that impact lives.<br>
<br>
If you don’t meet the entry requirements for a BA, you can study this course as an ‘extended’ four-year programme. You'll begin with a Social Science Foundation year which will prepare you for a successful transition to the BA degree.<br>

                                    This course offers the opportunity of year-long placement between years two and three. If you choose to take this option, you’ll spend your third year on a placement with a relevant company or organisation, adding valuable practical experience to your growing academic knowledge. <br>
<br>
The extra placement year means it will take four years to complete your studies, instead of three.

                    <p>This extended course is perfect if you want a degree in Graphic Design, but don’t meet the standard entry requirements. </p>
<p>
First we prepare you for your degree during the Foundation year, bringing you up to speed with academic skills and a firm grounding in the subject. Then you can go on to do the full undergraduate degree.</p>
<p>As a future talent of the graphic design industry, we’ll prepare you for the exciting new challenges this field offers. You’ll need the ability to work both individually and as part of a team, making large-scale projects happen and bringing big ideas to life.</p>
<p>To land the job you want in graphic design you’ll need to be a strong visual communicator in the delivery of future products, services and ideas. So we want to provide you with all the tools to experiment but also to explore and invent, as you examine where 21st-century design is heading.</p>
<p>Our expert teachers will help you identify where your potential truly lies. At the University of East London, we’re a team. We’ll value your ideas and we’ll give you the confidence to express and realise them.</p>
<p>We’ll prepare you for a rewarding future career in graphic design by looking at the practical skills involved, as well as giving you a firm grounding in academic theory. At the core of all you’ll study and create, there is an uplifting sense of the spirit of design here.</p>

                    This foundation year course is perfect if you want a degree in International Relations but you don’t have the standard entry requirements.<br>
<br>
First we prepare you for your degree during the Foundation year, bringing you up to speed with academic skills and a firm grounding in the subject. Then you can go on to do the full undergraduate degree.<br>
<br>
Do you want to make sense of the post-truth world, encapsulated by events such as Brexit and the US Election? Are you interested in understanding how global powers interact, both in times of war and peace?<br>
<br>
Would you like to know more about international organisations and their capacity to control and shape development around the world? Do you want to learn about political participation and become an active citizen, so that you can contribute to policy-making processes?<br>
<br>
If you answer 'Yes' to any of these questions, then our International Relations course is for you.<br>
<br>
Global politics has become increasingly turbulent, foundations and systems are being shaken, and relations between nations are being shifted and tested. There is a new demand for experts who are able to understand and work in this new political arena. With our innovative Politics and International Relations course, rated top in London for student satisfaction, we can equip you with the skills and knowledge to play an active role in this new world.<br>
<br>
There has never been a more pressing and fascinating time to study and make a career in international politics.

<br>
By the end of the degree you’ll gain the same qualification as those obtaining direct entry to the course but you’ll take one year longer to complete your studies. <br>

This BA has an extremely broad remit, from editorial publishing through to the guerrilla activists of Street Art, from book and magazine cover-design to zines and graphic novels.</div>
<div><br>
You’ll have the opportunity to develop your technical skills in drawing, printing, publishing, book-arts and object-making alongside the crucial media know-how to thrive in a swiftly developing visual culture.</div>
<div><br>
At the University of East London we place an emphasis on the narratives of our lives and about responding to the world in both image and text. Every human has a story and this course is about finding and valuing you own narrative. </div>
<div><br>
Digital technology has had a profound impact on our culture, especially on the world of visual communication, but the importance of the individualised creative ‘voice’ has never been so important.<br>

                    <p>*This course is subject to validation</p>
<p>Studying on BA (Hons) Graphic Design and Illustration you will have freedom to explore both graphic design and illustration without the stigma of working between or within subjects, allowing you to bridge between the two and go on to develop a practice that blurs the line between the two — a key characteristic that has become more common in industry.
</p>
<p>You will be able to develop an original, individual approach to creating graphic design and illustration, coupled with a thorough understanding of the social, cultural and professional context occupied by these two disciplines.
Having skills in both areas (feet in both camps) allows a more adaptable approach to taking on work and being successful, chiming with the requirements of the Creative Industries 4.0, where discipline distinctions become increasingly irrelevant to professional life.
</p>
<p>Towards the end of the course, in the final year, you will be able to gravitate towards one or other on the named subjects as your creative voice emerges. It’s that flexibility which is the underlying selling point of this course.</p>

                    <p>This is a practical, industry-led course, which is suitable for anyone already working in the construction industry, as well as for new students.<br>
You’ll have the opportunity to follow one of two routes, depending on what direction you want your career to take - civil engineering or construction management.<br>
Once you’ve completed the course successfully, you’ll be able to progress onto the final year of one of our honours degrees to obtain a BSc degree if you wish. These degrees are in either Civil Engineering or Construction Management.<br>
If you’re already in employment, you’ll spend four days a week in industry, while full-time students will undertake a compulsory work placement of up to four days a week in their final year. Whatever path you take, you’ll gain the knowledge and skills to become a first-class construction manager or civil engineer.<br>
Although we cannot guarantee a placement we will support you in providing opportunities to secure one.  If you do not secure a placement you will still be allowed to progress directly on to the BSc (Hons) degree course.</p>

                    <div>We’re proud of our reputation for igniting the talents of brilliant fine artists with the help and support of some of the biggest names in British art. This extended course is perfect if you want a degree in fine art but you don’t meet the standard entry requirements. </div>
<div>
First we prepare you for your degree during the Foundation year, bringing you up to speed with academic skills and a firm grounding in the subject. Then you can go on to do the full undergraduate degree.</div>
<div>
Our fine art students work across a range of disciplines, including drawing, painting, sculpture, installation, film, photography and performance.</div>
<div>
What exactly distinguishes fine artists? Well, they usually work independently, without a client. Their work may stand out for its beauty or meaningfulness thanks to innovative practice or a high level of craft or conceptual skills. Experimentation and risk-taking are an essential part of their individualism, too.</div>
<div>
The emergence of such singular talents has long marked out UEL’s Fine Art course as exceptional. We’ve been well known for nurturing groundbreaking artists since the Chapman brothers started making their dramatic impression back in the 1980s.</div>
<div>
It’s the diversity of our students and staff, with their wide, vastly differing backgrounds and experiences, which helps make this a uniquely rich and fascinating course.<br>

                    <p>This extended course is perfect if you want a degree in Event Management but don’t have the standard entry requirements. </p>
<p>We prepare you for your degree during the Foundation year, bringing you up to speed with academic skills and a firm grounding in the subject. You can then go on to study the full undergraduate degree.</p>
<p>From a birthday party to a music festival or a product launch to the World Cup final, memorable events make life special and take planning, skill and effort.</p>
<p>Our BA Event Management degree will provide you with the knowledge and skills you need to thrive in an industry that contributes an estimated £36 billion to the UK economy. And you’ll be learning just a few miles from some of the capital’s most famous venues, including the O2 Arena and the Olympic stadium.</p>
<p>You’ll gain an in-depth understanding of the theoretical side of event planning, development and management, and this will be backed up by site visits to gain a practical understanding of how to run events. </p>
<p>You’ll learn about the business principles underpinning the industry, with modules that cover marketing, finance and the law, as well as people and resource management.</p>

<p>This extended course is perfect if you want a degree in Media and Communications, but don’t meet the standard entry requirements. </p>
<p>
</p>
<div>
First we prepare you for your degree during the Foundation year, bringing you up to speed with academic skills and a firm grounding in the subject. Then you can go on to do the full undergraduate degree.</div>
<div><br>
The BA course looks at the media’s increasing reach and influence, providing you with the knowledge and skills to make sense of this dramatically and swiftly changing sector. Thanks to our close industry links, you’ll have the chance to undertake valuable work-based learning while on placement. </div>
<div><br>
We're proud that, based on recent research carried out by The Times, we're in the top seven courses in the country for media and communication. We like to think we're getting even better.</div>
<div><br>
As one of our students, Shaheen Abdouramane, says, “The course is extremely broad and is adaptable to suit the path you wish to take, whether it's media production, cultural studies, gender, race, journalism, advertising or a mixture of all of them. </div>
<div><br>
“The great thing is that the lecturers are enthusiastic about what they teach and the support is there if you need it.”<br>

                    <div></div>If you want to study creative writing but you don’t meet the standard entry requirements for a degree, this extended course is perfect for you. 
<p>First we prepare you for your degree during the foundation year, bringing you up to speed with academic skills and a firm grounding in the subject. Then you can go on to do the full undergraduate degree.<br>
<br>
And there has never been a more exciting time to be a writer. The internet has changed the world, increasing the scope for writers and their work. Our course recognises and embraces these opportunities. At UEL, we’re building a community of writers and artists with something to say about themselves, and about the world. <br>
<br>
Our unique programme invites you to experiment and dare to challenge traditional ways of looking at ‘genre’ in writing. We encourage you to explore multi-media approaches to your work and to experiment with poetry, prose, drama and different media. <br>
<br>
We’ll help you find your own path as a writer. You’ll be introduced to various types of writing across a range of disciplines, paving your way for employment in many different areas where your skills will be highly valued.<br>

                    <p>BA (Hons) Dance: Urban Practice, is a forward-thinking course that continues to increase in popularity nationally and internationally since it started in 2007. This vibrant and distinctive course offers students the chance to study with a dynamic and specialist skilled dance team in a great location that is the cultural hub of East London.</p>
<p>The foundation year at UEL is
the first year of a four-year programme which provides an introduction to study
at University and your chosen subject. The
Level 3 Foundation year in Performing Arts is designed to equip students with a
range of performance and academic skills.<br>
<br>
On this degree, we cover hip-hop, club, social and popular dance styles, with contemporary techniques from across Europe, Africa and Asia. Whether it is popping or locking, contemporary or capoeira, afro-house or bharata natyam, our course continues to be the first of its kind to offer a degree in dance without borders or limitations.<br>
<br>
You will have great opportunities to perform your work in our annual student led festival, studio sharings and external events.  The dance team will support and guide you to develop your skills as a researcher, choreographer, performer and in events management whilst giving you networking opportunities from our varied and exciting industry links. <br>
We help create dance all-rounders preparing you for a portfolio career in the arts. So you will theorise dance, create dance, collaborate in dance managing yourself and others and, well, you will discover and dance many various types of dance.</p>

                    This extended course is perfect if you want a film degree but you don’t meet the standard entry requirements. 
<div><br>
First we prepare you for your degree during the Foundation year, bringing you up to speed with academic skills and a firm grounding in the subject. Then you can go on to do the full undergraduate degree.</div>
<p>Some courses teach you about film-making while others concentrate on the theory and history of film. At UEL, we’ll give you a thorough, expert grounding in both.</p>
<p>We combine theory and practice, teaching you not just how to make films and videos but throwing you into every aspect of the film world, from screenwriting to cinema history.</p>
<div>Each year, you’ll make your own films, from fiction to documentaries. And in your last year, your final piece of work will be screened at a special show at a London cinema, attended by film industry executives.</div>
<div><br>
Throughout your course, you’ll get the opportunity to develop your production skills by studying modules focused on documentary, fiction, screenwriting and avant-garde filmmaking.</div>
<div><br>
We’ll give you the skills to work in all film-related fields. Our graduates have gone into a variety of rewarding careers, from film production to festival administration to film journalism.<br>

                    <div>This extended course is perfect if you want a degree in International Development with NGO Management, but you don’t have the standard entry requirements. 
<div><br>
First we prepare you for your degree during the Foundation year, bringing you up to speed with academic skills and a firm grounding in the subject. Then you can go on to do the full undergraduate degree.</div>
<div><br>
You’ll find out how social development is affecting the people who live in the world’s poorest countries? You’ll learn about globalisation and consider its impact on the people of Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean, the Middle East and Europe.  And you’ll explore the way NGOs work to address issues of poverty and whether there’s value in their work.</div>
<div><br>
You’ll have the chance to study for a term overseas. Recently students have studied in South Africa, Brazil, Thailand and at the American University in Cairo. In your third year, you will undertake a supported work placement with an NGO.</div>
<div><br>
On this course you’ll ‘learn by doing’, gaining the skills to become an informed and critical practitioner. You’ll contribute directly to practical solutions in the developing world and reflect on the impact of NGO work.</div>
<div><br>
International Development graduates from UEL are sought after for their rounded outlook and experience. They’ve landed jobs at organisations such as The World Health Organisation, The Refugee Council and Medecins Sans Frontieres.

First we prepare you for your degree during your Foundation year, bringing you up to speed with academic skills and a firm grounding in the subject.

<p>Your portfolio will feature your own animated short film, your responses to commercial briefs, character and concept designs, storyboards and illustration work.</p>
<p>Each year, you’ll learn skills that build on your previous learning, with a course structure that encourages your artistic independence while covering the broadest range of animation techniques. </p>
<div>You’ll develop a visual language through illustration workshops and apply this to your animation work, finding your own balance between the two complementary disciplines. </div>

                    <p>Whether it’s the fun of Super Mario or the horror of Resident Evil that consumes you, this is your chance to convert your passion for playing games into knowledge about how to create and design them.</p>
<p>You’ll get the most out of our course if you come with an interest in all kinds of games – board, card and pen-and-paper - not just digital ones. You’ll be amazed what you can learn from games like Munchkin or Dungeons and Dragons.</p>
<p>We run two games courses at UEL, subtly different but both sharing the same focus on designing games and game play.</p>
<p>Our course will equip you, like many of our successful graduates, for a role in the expanding games industry. We're justly proud of the imagination and quality of our students’ work. By the end of your course, you should be playing a game you designed and developed yourself – and hopefully following in the footsteps of the many UEL graduates now making their mark in the games industry.</p>
