<li>Do you love creative arts?</li>
<li>Can you develop creative work that startles or surprises?</li>
<li>Are you open to new ideas and creative challenges?</li>
<li>Do you have qualifications at A level/BTEC but not in Arts subjects?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Then Year Zero is for you.</strong></p>
<p>You’ll gain the fundamental knowledge, critical awareness and practical skills which are essential for all Arts students. Our emphasis is on building your confidence and fostering your creative potential. Supported by a dedicated team of professional staff, you’ll learn in a stimulating studio environment where you can explore and experiment with materials, processes and ideas. </p>
<p>The Year Zero route provides a smooth transition to degree courses in the Arts disciplines at the University (see list in 'about this course'). Ours is the most comprehensive programme of its kind in the Midlands.  </p>
<p>Whilst employment in the UK creative industries is growing at four times the rate of the UK workforce as a whole, there are fewer opportunities for young people to study arts subjects at school. However this doesn’t mean that you can’t follow your passion for the arts at university.</p>
<p>Derby’s Year Zero route is for students who have an interest in the arts but have never had the opportunity to study Arts at A-level/BTEC or for those who have changed their mind about a career after choosing their A-levels/BTECs. </p>
<p>Year Zero provides a smooth transition to degree courses in the Arts disciplines.

<p>The University of Derby Year Zero is one of the largest and most comprehensive programme of its kind in the Midlands.</p>
<p>You will have an individual space in the studio and have access to the following resources in our fully equipped workshops: woodwork, metalwork, glasswork, laser cutting, vacuum forming, printmaking, ceramics, plaster casting, photography and Photoshop.</p>
<p>This course is the first stage of a Bachelors Degree – it is not a standalone course. Following the successful completion of the year you'll then progress on to the first year of your chosen degree:</p>

    <p>Highly sought after due to their financial and business acumen, quantity surveyors often hold very senior positions in industry, local government and central government. You will find that career opportunities also exist in a number of related fields, including the built environment, civil and heavy engineering and the offshore and petrochemical industries.</p>
<p>Quantity surveyors are responsible for the cost of any building project - from initial estimates right through to the final acquisition of materials. Surveying jobs and their associated roles are varied, but generally focussed on providing clients with value for money while adhering to the strict regulations which govern every aspect of the construction industry.</p>
<p>Day-to-day responsibilities include roles inside the office, on the construction site or in meetings with clients and other project personnel. While the very nature of construction work ensures that no two projects are ever the same, a typical work day might involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>preparation of contracts, including details regarding the quantities of required materials</li>
<li>on-going cost analysis of maintenance and repair work</li>
<li>feasibility studies of client requests</li>
<li>analysing completed work and arranging payment to contractors</li>
<li>allocating upcoming work to contractors</li>
<li>site visits, assessments and projections for future work</li>
</ul>
<p>Quantity surveyors may choose to specialise in a specific area of the construction industry and concentrate on areas like property taxation, costing advice, maintenance of existing buildings and application to funding sources.</p>

<p>Studying Specialist Sports Journalism with a Foundation Year provides you with a firm grounding in the skills and knowledge you need and introduces you to the subject of journalism, enabling you to achieve your full honours degree in four years.</p>
<h3><strong>New skills for a new era</strong></h3>
<p>In an age of digital news, there has never been a more exciting or challenging time to study sports journalism. This dynamic course enables you to produce compelling content for both traditional and emerging media platforms.  And, unlike with other courses, you’ll have the opportunity to specialise in a sport of your choice – from minority sports through to cricket, rugby and football.</p>
<p>You'll gain the core journalistic research and writing skills as well as studying media law and ethics. At the same time, you’ll develop a multi-platform mindset, producing print, radio and TV reports as well as creating blogs and podcasts, digital photos, audio/video stories and content for websites and mobile devices.</p>

<p>We are collaborating closely with leading names in sport and media to ensure this degree delivers the right level of skills and knowledge. You’ll be equipped not only to cover sport as a journalist but also for the growing number of media relations roles in the sports industry.</p>
<p>The course has been developed following discussions with major media companies like the <a title=""BBC"" href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/"" target=""_blank"">BBC</a>, national and local newspapers, sports industry bodies and sports clubs themselves. Drawing on these strong partnerships, you’ll be able to extend your professional networks, gain practical work experience and hear guest lectures from experienced sports journalists.</p>
<h3><strong>Hone your expertise in sports news</strong></h3>
<p>Throughout your studies, you’ll gain significant hands-on experience of gathering and reporting news and information on your chosen sport.  You’ll also analyse traditional media coverage and the way in which social media and individual blogs are transforming sports journalism.</p>
<p>You are expected to gain an in-depth knowledge of your sport, covering every level from local grassroots players to the biggest names in international sport. We focus on the governance and business aspects of sport too, reflecting how these are never far from the headlines.</p>
<h3><strong>Exciting work experience opportunities</strong></h3>
<p>As part of your course, you’ll boost your CV by gaining practical work experience with a media or sports organisation in the UK or overseas. All our students are expected to have completed at least 15 days of work placement by the time they graduate.</p>
<p>The course features work-based modules where you can expand your professional know-how. We also encourage you to work with charities and other not-for-profit organisations to gain an insight into why media matters so much. In addition, you can contribute to the various print, radio and online news outlets at the University, which is itself a rich source of news and debate around sport.</p>
<h3><strong>Outstanding facilities</strong></h3>
<p>You'll be based at our main campus at Kedleston Road and at our Markeaton Street site where you'll discover our excellent facilities including three radio studios, a fully equipped television studio, video editing suites, Mac suites and a newsroom featuring the latest software.</p>

<h3><strong>Variety and versatility</strong></h3>
<p>Our emphasis is on fostering creative, versatile journalists with experience in a variety of production techniques. On top of this, you will gain journalistic expertise in your chosen sport, helping you to pursue a career in your specialist area of interest.</p>
<p>Alongside your traditional reporting skills, we want you to develop a passion for ideas and creative communication, to seek people out and find the human stories behind the headlines. You'll also focus on your intellectual and critical development, study research techniques and gain an understanding of audience theory.</p>
<h3><strong>Broaden your perspectives</strong></h3>
<p>We encourage all students to take part in international study, either through the <a href=""/study/study-abroad/study-or-work-abroad/study-or-work-abroad---student-opportunities/"">Erasmus scheme</a> which allows you to spend time at a university almost anywhere in Europe, or through our <a href=""/departments/humanities/american-exchange/"">American exchange programme</a>, in which you will spend a full semester studying at one of our partner universities in the USA:</p>
<ul>

You can gain named MRes awards in Social Research, Criminal Psychology, Humanities or Journalism, depending on the subject pathway you choose to take.</p>
<h3><strong>A broad appeal</strong></h3>
<p>The MRes is ideal for high-performing students who want to progress directly from undergraduate studies and to continue developing their experience of real-world and collaborative research. </p>
<p>With a part-time route available, it is also suited to professionals already working in roles which involve the collection and analysis of data to address complex challenges and underpin decision-making.</p>
<p>It will appeal in particular to ambitious individuals who want to advance their careers in settings such as the criminal justice sector, local authorities, police and probation services, the heritage sector and the media. They could be in roles which are specifically focussed on research or where they need to use data and evidence effectively.</p>
<h3><strong>In-depth knowledge, enhanced employability</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The MRes delivers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A critical awareness of current debates, problems and developments at the forefront of your academic or professional subject specialism</li>
<li>A comprehensive understanding of research methods, techniques and originality in research practice</li>
<li>Excellent critical thinking, evaluation and analysis skills so that you can test theories and engage in academic debate</li>
<li>Enhanced employability so that you are well prepared for higher level professional employment</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>A truly interdisciplinary approach</strong></h3>
<p>One of the strengths of our MRes programme is its emphasis on inter-disciplinary learning.  The course is uniquely structured so that you are trained in research methods and practice which are relevant across the social sciences and humanities, equipping you with a solid foundation of skills. </p>
<p>You will draw on best practice from different sectors, learning how they take distinctive approaches to research and knowledge production. Because the course is expected to attract individuals from different settings – from police officers to social workers, journalists to heritage sector professionals, to name but a few – you will benefit from sharing ideas and fresh perspectives.</p>
<h3><strong>Skills to take you far</strong></h3>
<p>After a vital introduction to research philosophy and methodology, you will develop your skills via a series of masterclasses. We cover issues such as how to conduct reviews of existing literature; how to collect and analyse qualitative data through interviews and focus groups; how to harness quantitative data such as social statistics; and how to use archives.</p>
<p>In addition, we focus on your personal development as a researcher, exploring how to present research evidence and get it published; research and project planning techniques; different sources of research funding; and ways to ensure your research has impact.</p>
<h3><strong>Pursue your personal and professional interests</strong></h3>
<p>Alongside generic research skills, you will have the chance to concentrate on the discipline of your choice – Social Research, Criminal Psychology, Humanities or Journalism – and the advanced research methods relevant to that discipline. You will also choose from a further menu of specialist masterclasses in your subject area, drawing on the expertise of University staff. Current options cover everything from critical theory and policy analysis to the sociology of violence, from emerging technologies in journalism to reading the past through historic houses.</p>
<p>This feeds into your independent research project which forms the culmination of your studies. Those students who are already working can choose a theme which reflects their role at work and addresses a real-world issue important to their organisation.</p>
<h3><strong>A dynamic research environment</strong></h3>
<p>We provide a challenging, stimulating environment where new researchers can develop and excel. In joining the growing postgraduate community at the University of Derby, you will be inspired by influential researchers whose work is advancing knowledge, transforming professional practice and sparking debate in many areas of humanities and social sciences.</p>
<p>A key aim of the MRes is to promote the co-production of research between students and University staff, so you will enjoy opportunities to contribute to significant research outputs.</p>
<h3><strong>Draw on our professional networks</strong></h3>
<p>Our thriving links with employers and stakeholders in sectors such as local government, national and international social policy, heritage and criminal justice also open up wide-ranging opportunities for collaborative research.</p>
<p>We may therefore be able to help you identify practice-based research projects in particular sectors and organisations. You will also benefit from a programme of guest lectures featuring leading practitioners who will share their expertise and knowledge with you.</p>
<h3><strong>Flexibility to suit you</strong></h3>
<p>A highly flexible structure means you can study for the full MRes award or complete shorter programmes culminating in a Postgraduate Certificate or Postgraduate Diploma.</p>
<p>The Postgraduate Diploma route entails a shorter final research project and leads to a named award in your chosen specialism. You can also take just the three research training modules to gain a Postgraduate Certificate in Research Methods in the Social Sciences and Humanities.</p>
</section>",,"<section class=""text-block"" role=""region"" id=""text-block-21372"">
<a id=""d.en.21372""></a>
    
    <p>The MRes could be your route into an academic research position or a role as a researcher or research manager in the public, private or voluntary sectors.</p>
<p>The skills you gain on the programme are highly valued by employers from a wide range of settings, especially those where research is harnessed to solve problems related to professional practice. You will be able to demonstrate that you are confident and adept in researching, judging and evaluating complex information; making reasoned arguments; formulating and solving problems; managing projects; using effective methods to communicate your conclusions, and developing new ideas.</p>
<p>For those individuals who take the MRes as part of their continuing professional development, the qualification also paves the way to new opportunities, responsibilities and promotion prospects.</p>
<p>In addition, the MRes programme provides an excellent platform if you want to advance to PhD research and a future career in academic research.</p>

<p>With a dynamic and innovative curriculum, our new MA programme enables you to focus on the role of history in the public sphere and equips you for careers ranging from museum curation to heritage education.</p>
<h3>Join a thriving industry</h3>
<p>The evidence of the past surrounds us and is constantly called upon, reshaped and reimagined in the present.</p>
<p>Research conducted by <a title=""Historic England"" href=""https://historicengland.org.uk/"" target=""_blank"">Historic England</a> in 2015 revealed how heritage now plays a key role in the broader economy of the UK, driving international tourism and generating income for local communities.</p>
<p>The strong growth in visitor numbers at historic properties since 2001 also underlines how the heritage industry is not only a major source of employment but also one of the most frequent ways that members of the public engage with the past.</p>
<p>Our MA Public History and Heritage has been launched to help you make the most of the many career opportunities emerging in this burgeoning industry. It offers a relatively rare opportunity to undertake masters level academic research while gaining practical experience and advanced training in heritage sector roles.</p>
<h3>Immerse yourself in Derbyshire’s history</h3>
<p>Where better to study public history and heritage than Derbyshire? From fine aristocratic estates to the archaeology of the Industrial Revolution, our county encapsulates many aspects of England’s historical experience.</p>
<p>Heritage attractions such as museums, galleries and country houses are key to our city and county’s appeal, with annual visitor numbers reaching almost 40 million.</p>
<p>As part of your studies, you will explore a range of heritage sites with global significance. These include the UNESCO-recognised Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site which lies only minutes away from our Derby campus, and various National Trust and English Heritage properties.</p>
<h3>Strong industry partnerships</h3>
<p>Our flourishing links with the heritage, creative and cultural industries will open doors for you. The course gives you access to producers of public history and heritage, such as local authorities, charitable trusts, businesses, community groups and private individuals. You will therefore gain unrivalled experience of the different practical, legal, commercial and management challenges facing the sector today.</p>
<p>Our partnerships span organisations with international profiles. As well as Derwent Valley Mills, they include Derby Museums Trust, which incorporates the Derby Silk Mill, site of the world’s first factory now being redeveloped as a ‘Museum of Making’.  The Trust also holds landmark works by Joseph Wright of Derby, designated by Arts Council England as a collection of national importance.</p>
<h3>Real-world learning in action</h3>
<p>You’ll undertake a work-based consultancies in a public history or heritage-related organisation, go on frequent field trips and undertake employer-led projects.</p>
<p>Employability skills are embedded in every aspect of the course, so you will benefit from practical training in areas such as heritage management, audience research, policy writing, fundraising, curation – including digital curation – marketing and communication.</p>
<p>At the same time, you will explore advanced academic and conceptual debates around public history and heritage. The MA culminates in a research-based dissertation on a relevant theme of your choice. </p>
<h3>Projects to bring the past to life</h3>
<p>There is the chance for you to undertake wide-ranging projects on behalf of arts and heritage organisations. You will work to ‘live briefs’ set by employers which reflect current opportunities and pressures within the sector.</p>
<p>Among latest initiatives, our students have been designing exhibits charting the history of Derbyshire County Cricket Club and transforming the visitor experience at Derby Silk Mill as part of the international ‘Museomix’ event. </p>
<p>In other enterprising collaborations, students are working in partnership with Derbyshire County Record Office to encourage young people to take a greater interest in archives and with the National Brewery Centre in Burton to chronicle the history of brewing.</p>
<h3>Learn from the experts</h3>
<p>You will be taught by a team of academic historians and heritage industry experts who can share cutting-edge practice in their fields. They include renowned researchers and authors, who work regularly as consultants on restoration projects and major exhibitions.</p>
<p>The MA opens up wide-ranging opportunities for you to network with heritage professionals inside and outside the classroom – not only on work placements but also through our exciting programme of field visits, guest speakers, conferences and public events.</p>

    <p>Police leaders today have to operate in a transparent, ethical and highly accountable arena - where their decisions are often scrutinised by politicians, the media and the general public. The Policing vision 2025 outlines the plan for professionalising policing over the next ten years, and acknowledges the social and political challenges our forces face. Our MSc in Police Leadership, Strategy and Organisation aims to meet the professional development of current and future leaders as well as providing a provision for individuals with high potential and capacity to shape the future of the profession. </p>
<h3>Meeting 21st century priorities</h3>
<p>This exciting course offers a unique combination of the latest business and management thinking, criminology and social sciences - all applied to the complex challenges of contemporary policing. It has been launched at a time of calls for greater public accountability, the growing importance of community partnerships and, in some quarters, a crisis of confidence in the integrity of police services.</p>
<p>Our MSc goes well beyond traditional public sector skills and generic leadership programmes. It gives you an in-depth knowledge of the critical issues surrounding police accountability, independence, policing effectiveness, performance and organisational transformation. It will stretch and inspire you to take your leadership skills to the highest professional standards.</p>
<h3>Acclaimed expertise</h3>
<p>We have built a reputation as a world-leading provider of police education and we have one of the largest teams of academics with policing experience in any UK university. They include former police leaders as well as academic researchers whose cutting-edge work is helping to shape the national and international development of policing. You’ll also draw on the wider expertise available at the University in areas such as business, law, HR and economics.</p>
<h3>Powerful networks</h3>
<p>You’ll benefit from the wisdom of some of the most influential figures in policing today. We pride ourselves on a superb network of contacts, from chief constables and crime commissioners, to the representatives from national policing organisations such as <a title=""HMIC"" href=""http://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/hmic/"" target=""_blank"">Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary</a>, the <a title=""College of Policing"" href=""http://www.college.police.uk/Pages/Home.aspx"" target=""_blank"">College of Policing</a>, the <a href=""https://www.managers.org.uk/"">Chartered Management Institute </a>and representatives of the private sector. They have played a key role in the design of our course to ensure it matches the needs of the profession today.</p>
<p>These strong partnerships mean we can offer an outstanding visiting speaker programme, enabling you to discuss issues - in complete confidence - with leaders in the field. We also host regular events with organisations such as the <a title=""Society of Evidence Based Policing"" href=""http://www.sebp.police.uk/"" target=""_blank"">Society of Evidence-based Policing</a> and the <a title=""BSC"" href=""http://britsoccrim.org/new/index.php"" target=""_blank"">British Society of Criminology</a>.</p>
<h3>A truly global outlook</h3>
<p>Our approach provides a unique bridge between policing in the UK and the rest of the world. While other police leadership courses focus primarily on the UK and USA, our MSc boasts a broader international perspective and you’ll find yourself sharing insights and experience with senior police officers from around the world.</p>
</section>",,"<section class=""text-block"" role=""region"" id=""text-block-22101"">
<a id=""d.en.22101""></a>
    
    <p>At a time when recruitment to senior roles in the police is changing, this MSc provides an excellent professional development route. For ambitious police professionals - in the UK and overseas - the qualification will not only showcase their knowledge and abilities but also accelerate their career progress. It provides a vital next step for those who have developed general business and leadership skills but need to operate in a higher profile context.</p>
<p>The course will also act as an important stepping stone for middle or senior managers in other sectors who are keen to move into police leadership. In addition, it will help graduates in subjects such as criminology or business to build an impressive CV and prepare for managerial roles in policing, security or related fields.</p>
<h3>Ongoing careers support</h3>
<p>Our <a title=""CES"" href=""http://www.derby.ac.uk/study/careers/"" target=""_blank"">Careers and Employment Service</a> will provide you with help, guidance and support from day one of your course - and for up to three years after you’ve completed your studies.

<p>This course is underpinned by the desire to deliver kind, compassionate nursing care. It is a two year, full-time degree and supports those with a prior degree (2:2 or above) to become a registered mental health nurse at an accelerated pace. You will also need prior work experience in a service user context, allowing you to demonstrate the skills that underpin professional nursing registration. Your prior experiences will contribute to the learning opportunities within the course and together these will provide eligibility to register as a mental health nurse with the <a title=""NMC"" href=""http://www.nmc.org.uk/"" target=""_blank"">Nursing and Midwifery Council</a> (NMC), as long as you meet the <a href=""https://www.nmc.org.uk/"" target=""_blank"">NMC’s requirements</a>.</p>

By studying this course you can be confident that you will meet the standards and competences contained within the NMC Standards for Pre-registration Nursing Programmes and Standards of proficiency for registered nurses (NMC 2018). The Postgraduate Diploma/MSc Nursing is an intensive course and you will need commitment, motivation and a desire to succeed. The programme holds high expectations that you are engaged and ready to be an independent learner and that you are able to meet the theory and practice hours required by the NMC that reflect a full time programme of study.</p>
<p>A significant amount of time in practice will be spent working alongside qualified nurses, applying theory to practice to develop key clinical skills and the ability to work as a professional in practice. Throughout the course you will experience a wide variety of practice learning environments across the Derbyshire region. These practice environments include hospitals; community settings; private, voluntary and independent sectors. Whilst on placement you will be required to experience a full range of shift patterns relevant to the practice environment you are placed in.</p>
<p>You will engage in high fidelity simulated practice within the university and also be expected to engage in clinical supervision. Both of which will enhance and support your development as a confident and competent practitioner.</p>

<ul>
<li>To be a registered nurse with the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) or relevant nursing profession regulator in your country of residence or employment</li>
<li>Hold at least a lower second class (2:2) undergraduate honours degree of a UK university, the CNAA or an overseas equivalent</li>
</ul>
<h3>Non-Standard Entry</h3>
<p>Exceptionally, we may admit registered nurses without an academic award comparable to a lower second class (2:2) undergraduate honours degree, where you can demonstrate the potential to achieve the aims and outcomes of the curriculum.</p>
<p>You will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>To be a registered nurse with the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) or relevant nursing profession regulator in your country of residence or where you are employed</li>
<li>To provide evidence of at least ten years' experience as a registered nurse, also to demonstrate continued learning, whether that is through professional development and/or academic study</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, you will be required to attend a virtual interview with the Programme Leader, and you will need to pass the first module to confirm progression onto the rest of the programme.</p>
<p>For non-standard entry, the Programme Leader will consider your:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level of current qualifications</li>
<li>Experience of working in a nursing or health care related setting, the roles undertaken and the level of decision making undertaken</li>
<li>Motivation for undertaking the programme</li>

    <p>Registered nurses with a masters qualification are well positioned to advance their career in nursing, health and social care, education, or leadership and management roles.</p>
<p>Studying for this masters award will enable you to critically explore professional issues in depth, and use this new knowledge in your role, ultimately to benefit patient / client care.</p>
<p>For nurses registered with the NMC, your studies may contribute to your triennial revalidation, and for nurses governed by a regulator elsewhere in the world, studying at postgraduate level demonstrates a commitment to lifelong learning and ambition to excel as a healthcare practitioner to provide the very best care and lead others in doing the same.</p>
<h3>Clinical, managerial and academic career prospects</h3>
<p>You may be looking to advance your career in a clinical area in the UK such as senior sister, matron, clinical nurse specialist or researcher or move to an education role within the health and social care or higher education sectors, with equivalent roles available in your domicile if you are based outside the UK.</p>
<p>It is also possible to continue your studies at doctoral level, whether this is via a traditional PhD or professional doctorate route. Because this programme is open to registered nurses across the globe, the terminology used and structure of how health and social care is delivered may vary from country to country but the value of postgraduate study towards career advancement, remains globally relevant.</p>

<p>Our new MA Music Therapy helps meet a growing demand for expert practitioners who can harness the power of music in health, social care and community settings.</p>
<h3>Join a worthwhile profession</h3>
<p>Music therapy can have a significant impact on quality of life for people with learning difficulties, disabilities, dementia and mental health issues. It can also play an important role in palliative care, adoption scenarios, forensic work and in a broad range of other interventions which promote inclusivity and wellbeing.</p>
<p>This course will equip you with the skills to use music in ways which stimulate creativity, problem-solving and positive change.</p>
<p>‌The title of Music Therapist is legally protected and you need a masters qualification to practise. Our MA Music Therapy is aligned to standards set by the <a title=""HCPC"" href=""http://www.hcpc-uk.co.uk/"" target=""_blank"">Health and Care Professions Council</a> (HCPC), which acts as the regulatory body for music therapists.</p>
<p>Successful completion of the course means you can register with the HCPC to practise as a music therapist in the UK. When you embark on the MA, you can also apply to join the <a title=""BAMT"" href=""http://www.bamt.org/"" target=""_blank"">British Association for Music Therapists</a> (BAMT) as a trainee and, on finishing your training, as a practitioner.</p>
<h3>A course with broad appeal</h3>
<p>Our course is ideal for aspiring music therapists with a first degree in subjects relating to therapeutic arts, music, education and health, as well as for professionals with experience in appropriate health and social care settings.</p>
<p>It has the advantage of being delivered at the heart of the country in Derby. The flexible study format means that you are expected to attend the University on only one full day each week, with the rest of the time dedicated to clinical placements and self-directed study.</p>
<h3>Hone your skills on placement</h3>
<p>Practical experience is a cornerstone of this course and essential for meeting HCPC standards. You’ll spend a significant proportion of your time on placement, working directly with a range of clients and learning to manage caseloads.</p>
<p>You could be placed with health, social care and community employers or with music therapists running their own practices. You’ll receive expert clinical supervision from a dedicated placement supervisor. Throughout the MA, you’ll also draw on real-world case study materials to ensure your learning is up to date and relevant.</p>
<h3>Improve your musicianship</h3>
<p>Our therapeutic arts courses are distinctive because they place the art form at the heart of practice. Music and performance, musicality and improvisation will be central to your learning. We will enhance your musicianship while developing your critical understanding of theory and research. You’ll also take part in a Music Therapy Experiential Group and complete an independent study into a musicianship theme of your choice.</p>
<h3>An integrative approach</h3>
<p>We work with an integrative approach to understanding the therapeutic relationship, considering person centered, music-centred and psychodynamic approaches. The focus is on helping clients to strengthen their inner resources so that they feel they can make positive changes in their lives.</p>
<p>Reflecting this ethos, you will be required to engage with persoanl therapy yourself for the full duration of the course.</p>
<h3>Dynamic learning experiences</h3>
<p>You’ll be taught by an enthusiastic, expert team experienced in all forms of arts therapy. The course includes reflective practice groups facilitated by registered music therapists and substantial practical work in our bespoke music studio with a wide range of instruments.</p>
<p>There are valuable opportunities for you to learn with – and from – students from other disciplines. This prepares you to work in a multi-professional team and achieve the best outcomes for your clients.</p>
<p>You’ll find our tutors are friendly, approachable and encouraging – they pride themselves on offering exceptional support to students.</p>
<h3>An impressive track record</h3>
<p>We have a strong reputation for excellence in therapeutic arts and have prepared hundreds of students for careers in education, health and community arts.</p>
<p>The MA builds on our expertise in offering a Music pathway on our popular BA (Hons) Creative Expressive Arts, Health and Wellbeing. It also complements our other masters degrees in Art Therapy, Dramatherapy and Dance Movement Psychotherapy. With Music Therapy joining our portfolio, we believe we are the only university in the country to offer such a comprehensive range of postgraduate courses in this field.</p>

<li>We offer a highly flexible part-time pathway that will appeal to a wide range of health care professionals who wish to develop ultrasound skills as an extension of their scope of practice</li>
<li>You can choose to study our innovative full-time, fast-track pathway designed for science and health related graduates wishing to explore a career in this exciting and rapidly expanding area of diagnostic imaging. Our fast track students will gain an MSc in just two years</li>
<li>You’ll receive high quality teaching from friendly, supportive and enthusiastic staff, who are clinically and research active</li>
<li>You’ll engage in practice based learning in a clinical environment with expert mentor support</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultrasound is an essential tool in medical diagnosis. In recent years demand has grown beyond all expectations. This has resulted in expansion of the modality both in imaging departments and point of care clinical settings.</p>
<p>To meet this demand we have created our MSc Ultrasound to offer you the opportunity to train in general or very focused ultrasound applications. You’ll be taught in our modern Clinical Skills Suite by some of the area’s leading experts in this field and using state of the art simulation systems.</p>
<p>The course is modular, offering both full-time and part-time enrolment options to help you fit your professional development into your lifestyle. Our part-time pathway is flexible in its design, delivery and assessment to help you meet the demands of work and family commitments. A broad range of negotiated modules allow you to put together a programme of study that meets your individual learning needs, supporting your individual career aspirations.</p>
<p>We welcome applicants from a diverse range of graduate backgrounds. It’s the perfect opportunity for graduates with an interest in ultrasound to train in a field which is in high demand.</p>
<p>You must have access to a clinical ultrasound placement for a minimum of two days per week. For full-time students only, placements are provided with partner NHS Trusts (whilst we will always consider your placement preference, please note that a specific placement location cannot be guaranteed). Please note that if you are a part-time student you will need to source a placement independently.</p>

    <p>On successful completion of all core and mandatory elements, you will be able to provide evidence of preparation for practice to the standards required for a first post-qualification sonographer post. We’ve consulted with key service partners who have confirmed that this would allow appointment of graduates in most regional NHS contexts. However, applicants from a non-health care background should note that, at present, employment in some NHS Trusts would not be possible due to the requirement for professional registration. These potential restrictions on employment will be discussed with you during the application process and you will be asked to sign a memorandum of agreement confirming your understanding and acceptance.</p>
<p>At present, sonography is not a registerable health care profession. On successful completion of the full MSc in Medical Ultrasound, graduate entrants (who do not hold an existing registerable qualification) will not be eligible for HCPC registration. However, in collaboration with CASE and the Society and College of Radiographers, this course has been mapped closely against existing HCPC standards of proficiency for diagnostic imaging.</p>
<p>On completion of the MSc you will be able to apply for registration with the <a title=""SOR"" href=""http://www.sor.org/practice/ultrasound/register-sonographers"" target=""_blank"">Society and College of Radiographers</a> Public Voluntary Register of Sonographers. Details of the application process can be found on their website.</p>
<p>UK CASE accredited ultrasound awards are recognised both nationally and internationally.

<p>This course is accredited by the <a href=""http://www.bacp.co.uk/"">British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy</a> (BACP), so you can be sure it’s relevant and recognised within the psychotherapeutic and health care profession. The course will help you to further your career and become a BACP accredited and autonomous counselling practitioner.</p>
<p>The MSc in Integrative Counselling and Psychotherapy provides an innovative approach to psychotherapeutic practice that enables you to learn about three different psychotherapeutic approaches; person-centered, attachment theory, and cognitive behavior psychotherapy. A trans-theoretical model is used to provide a framework to integrate these theories to acknowledge the complexities of human problems in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>You’ll be encouraged to develop your understanding of the theoretical, social, cultural and ideological contexts in which your clients perceive, confront and manage problems. You’ll also consider and analyse major trends and orientations within integrative therapeutic work and develop your ability to identify and use appropriate sources of supervision within counselling practice.</p>
<p>Apart from the first module of the first year, you’ll need to provide clinical supervised practice in your own place of work or in your placement. This will allow you to put your enhanced knowledge of counselling and psychotherapy into practice and is an important element of the course. The hours of clinical practice vary for each academic year.</p>
<p>The teaching will vary, depending on the module, to provide you with the most effective learning strategies. You can expect to learn through debates and discussions, experiential exercises, problem-solving, lectures and tutorials. Assessments also vary from written assignments through to practical assessments and a final dissertation at the master’s stage. Your personal tutor will support you in your studies.</p>
<p>We’re proud to say that our courses are closely mapped against the health and social care sector. This ensures that our curriculum is up-to-date, providing you with the assurance that your learning is current and relevant. This does mean that we do have to respond to national changes such as government policy.</p>

    <p>This innovative course has been designed to produce graduates who can actively contribute to the global energy transition, have the ability to tackle climate change and the expertise to combine emerging techniques with conventional ones. You will consider a variety of energy sources, with your main focus being on how we can responsibly obtain energy from the Earth (conventional and unconventional hydrocarbons and geothermal energy) and how we mitigate global warming (carbon capture and subsurface storage, a key technology that many governments are deeming to be imperative to meet their carbon unit quotas).</p>
<p>The course aims to view energy from all aspects: finding, producing, assessing impact, and protecting the climate while powering the economy and providing for society. You will be able to apply traditional exploration and production skills to provide for future global power while ensuring a sustainable climate. On the course, you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gain an understanding of locating and evaluating hydrocarbon sources</li>
<li>Apply your knowledge of related energy options to prepare for a carbon-neutral transition, such as geothermal energy and carbon capture</li>
<li>Undertake relevant software training: seismic interpretation, GIS, petrophysics, gravity &amp; magnetics, reservoir/fluid modelling, to prepare you for industry</li>
<li>Gain practical skills (such as core logging and wireline log interpretation) that enhance employability</li>
<li>Use critical evaluation of datasets, creating industry-standard reports, which will build confidence in guiding companies towards the right mix of energy utilisation and climate protection</li>
<li>Collaborate on live projects with UK Geoenergy Observatories to put your skills into practice</li>
<li>Be able to provide solutions which carefully balance providing affordable and sustainable energy with enhancing social, economic, and environmental prosperity</li>
<li>Study content aligned to the priorities of global initiatives, such as the UK Clean Growth strategy, and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals where 'affordable and clean energy' is listed as a priority</li>
<li>Work with our research-active teaching team who have a wealth of experience in renewable energy, climate change, and conventional and unconventional hydrocarbons</li>

    <p>There has been a major shift by energy providers, who now include sustainable practice into their plans, as well as government officials across the world creating blueprints for a more sustainable future. The world is now taking notice of the action needed to carefully balance energy generation with environmental management, providing exciting opportunities to be a part of such a defining moment in our history. </p>
<p>To succeed in this new era of energy production and secure a sustainable mixed-energy economy, the sector requires leaders who are bold, knowledgeable and inventive in their approach. Our MSc in GeoEnergy will equip you with a solid knowledge of the application of a wide variety of geological techniques to identify energy-rich areas, and the ability to select and carry out the appropriate methods of producing energy while reducing CO<sub>2</sub> output to the atmosphere. The course prepares you to excel in organisations who produce strategies with a single energy focus, as well as those with combined energy strategies. You will have gained the skill sets that are vital not only to oil and gas industries but also to environmental agencies and consultancies, alternative energy companies and geo-technical companies.</p>

We feel confident that you will appreciate the personal and professional benefits of this therapy as a means of support and understanding of the psychotherapeutic process. </p>
<p>We welcome guest speakers and offer perspectives on international, national and global approaches.

<p>You’ll use and reflect on psychotherapeutic theory, while considering the implications for placement and practice.</p>
<p>The somatic understanding in psychotherapeutic practice is an essential foundation of Dance and Movement Psychotherapy. You’ll also explore anatomy and physiology, which are essential to your understanding of movement and its relevance for psychotherapy through experiential mediums in arts- based practice and in particular dance.</p>
<p>We have excellent facilities, including a <a href=""/study/facilities/dance-studio/"">dance studio</a> and enjoy cooperation and commonality with the other Arts Therapies.</p>

<p>This exciting new MSc has been launched at a time when a process of swift and relentless change is transforming our justice system. This process aims to develop and sustain a high performing, efficient and effective criminal and community justice system which both benefits victims and rehabilitates those who offend.</p>
<h3>Broad appeal and relevance</h3>
<p>Our course is designed for anyone with an interest in the critical social and political challenges which crime presents. It will appeal to recent graduates with a first degree in a relevant subject area who want to deepen their knowledge. It is equally valuable for current practitioners and managers within the criminal justice, rehabilitative and penal systems, including social workers and social work managers, prison governors or officers, police officers and lawyers.</p>
<p>You will become part of a dynamic learning community bringing together students from diverse backgrounds who have real-world experience of criminal justice. This means you will benefit from fascinating insights into how different professionals and organisations address current issues in crime, criminal justice and punishment.</p>
<h3>New perspectives on crime</h3>
<p>The need for fresh and innovative thinking about crime – informed by academically credible research – has never been greater. This applies to the problems of tackling corporate crime, state crime and terrorism as well as to specific types of offending behaviour and examples of recent cases where offenders subject to supervision have gone on to commit more serious crimes.</p>
<p>You will examine all these issues within the context of a comprehensive and detailed analysis of crime control and the criminal justice process, including the courts, probation and prison. You will also explore the most recent developments in criminological theory and research.</p>
<p>Our modules are structured around wide-ranging criminological debates, including criminal behaviour; comparative criminology; victimology; penology; crime prevention; crime, media and popular culture; civil liberties and human rights; gender; and race and ethnicity.</p>
<p>You will also hone high-level research and policy formulation skills to underpin the independent study project that is a cornerstone of your MSc. You can choose an original theme which reflects your personal interests, career aspirations or current job role.</p>
<h3>Interdisciplinary and international approaches</h3>
<p>The course is framed by our rigorous interdisciplinary and critical approach. You will develop an advanced understanding of crime, deviance and criminal justice through a combination of theoretical, policy, legal, political and practical perspectives.</p>
<p>By exploring competing theoretical standpoints, we will challenge your thinking about the role of the state and the criminal justice system in the regulation of human behaviour, and about the place and limitations of criminal justice interventions in producing safe societies.</p>
<p>You will also compare the role and function of criminal justice processes and policy-making in England and Wales with those of other global jurisdictions.</p>
<h3>Build your professional skills and networks</h3>
<p>Thanks to our strong emphasis on real-world learning, this course will equip you with the qualities, skills, knowledge, professional values and personal awareness for a wide range of roles in criminal justice, penal and rehabilitative work settings.</p>
<p>We have extensive links with criminal justice organisations which will enhance your learning, including a programme of guest lectures where leading practitioners share their expertise and knowledge.</p>
<h3>An inspiring learning environment</h3>
<p>This course is delivered at One Friar Gate Square, home of our Law and Criminology programmes. A modern, iconic building in the heart of the city centre, it is the perfect environment for innovative and engaging teaching. </p>

<p>Innovative and stimulating, this course combines academic rigour and practical experience to nurture high-calibre, confident and forward-thinking investigation professionals.</p>
<h3>A broad appeal</h3>
<p>The MSc Criminal Investigation is designed to appeal to graduates from traditional academic backgrounds as well as serving investigation professionals.</p>
<p>We welcome applicants with substantial and relevant professional experience who may not have an undergraduate degree or equivalent qualification. </p>
<h3>Meeting professional standards</h3>
<p>Ensuring greater professionalism in investigation procedures is crucial to meet public expectations for effective and efficient policing and justice. This programme helps investigators to extend their skills while enabling the organisations that rely on investigations to enhance their performance.</p>
<p>The course has been introduced at a time when professionalisation in policing is a commonly agreed target of all police forces, the College of Policing and the National Crime Agency. In developing this programme, we have aligned it to initiatives such as the Professionalising Investigation Programme (PIP), which is jointly sponsored by the <a title=""NPCC"" href=""http://www.npcc.police.uk/"" target=""_blank"">National Police Chiefs’ Council</a> and the <a title=""College of Policing"" href=""http://www.college.police.uk/Pages/Home.aspx"" target=""_blank"">College of Policing</a>.</p>
<h3>Gain practical experience</h3>
<p>You will build the skills you need to conduct serious and complex investigations from the start to the end of a case. This includes gathering initial information from wide-ranging sources, managing intelligence and preparing high quality evidence for prosecution. There is also a strong focus on interviewing witnesses, victims and suspects using appropriate techniques.</p>
<p>The focus on professional practice you gain will be underpinned by the ethical and critical contexts of masters-level academic study, meeting UK accreditation standards for higher education.</p>
<h3>Invaluable perspectives</h3>
<p>The MSc Criminal Investigation will help you advance your investigative career in law enforcement, finance, health and safety, social services and many other sectors.</p>
<p>It addresses key challenges facing the investigation professional, including the changing nature of law enforcement and the ‘civilianisation’ of investigation. You will gain a greater appreciation of the social, moral and diversity issues underpinning both practice and research. </p>
<h3>Expertise to inspire you</h3>
<p>We draw upon a teaching team with more than a century of professional experience in investigation. You will be taught by influential academics who engage in a diversity of national and international research projects. This ensures your learning is enriched by the latest thinking and ideas.</p>
<p>Thanks to our strong professional links, we also offer an outstanding visiting speaker programme where leading practitioners share their experiences.</p>
<h3>Tailor your studies</h3>
<p>You will have a choice of two optional modules which cover areas such as financial and digital intelligence, and investigating sexual offences means that you can follow a study which reflects your personal interests or professional role. Alternatively, you may wish to substitute the optional modules to follow a specific pathway in investigating domestic abuse or investigating child sexual exploitation offences. For the masters stage of the course, you will undertake an independent study project exploring a significant topic of your choice.</p>
<h3>Our facilities</h3>
<p>Our facilities include an on-site classroom, interview suite, a <a href=""/study/facilities/forensic-training-facility/"">crime scene house</a> and forensic crime labs. Such is their quality that they are regularly used for training police officers, detectives and forensic experts.</p>
<h3>A global outlook</h3>
<p>Our MSc Criminal Investigation is based upon the investigative context and principles of the UK. Most of these principles will be generally applicable to many countries, and as part of your studies, you may undertake comparisons of selected contemporary international approaches, informed by overseas partnerships.</p>
<p>You may find yourself sharing insights and experiences with students and practitioners from various parts of the world.</p>

You will also develop and apply research and analysis skills to the standards of UK higher education accreditation at masters level.</p>
<p>The course has been mapped to the national occupational standards for criminal investigation. This means that, on successful completion of your MSc, you may claim Accredited Prior Learning (APL), which paves the way for you to pursue civilian roles related to criminal investigation. If you are a police officer, you may seek professional recognition for completing an MSc aligned with the Professionalising Investigation Programme (PIP).</p>

<p>The course gives all students the opportunity to undertake arranged work experience in the arts or in communication. Graduates leave this MA with a portfolio of their own writing, prepared for a career as arts professionals (including but not limited to publication) and progression to doctoral level study</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>Innovative specialised pathways</h5>
<p>The MA Creative Writing has a core programme (the MA Creative Writing) and two pathway awards: Gaming and Publishing. All of the core programme modules are specifically designed to suit their purpose and carefully integrated with each other. The programme takes into account on going research as well as developments, trends and innovations within the discipline and industries which it attends to.<br> <br> The core programme is modular, offering the flexibility to study in more than one writing form or genre, or focus on a single project. The teaching method encourages a gradual specialisation over the three trimesters. You participate in a core workshop in the first, where you read and respond both to published work and the work of peers. In the second trimester you work with supervisors who develop your writing in smaller group apprenticeships. In the summer you work on a significant  writing project on your own or in partnership with a community or industry.</p>
<p>Every student develops and reflects on their own writing and the writing of others by attending writing workshops. Depending on their pathway, students have the option of learning about voice and narrative, critical theory, writing for clients and publishing. All students have the opportunity of engaging in work experience. Professional development ranges from learning about publishing, Arts Council and literary agency interactions to writing in the community and collaborative projects.<br> <br> Each pathway, including the central award, consists of four core 20 credit modules, two option choices from four 20 credit modules and one option choice from two 60 credit modules. All of the pathways and the core award allow students to choose from two modules from the MA Publishing. The Publishing pathway allows students to specialise further in publishing by taking another module from the MA Publishing. In this way students are able to specialise in industry applications of creative writing.</p>
<p>Take a look at what our staff and students had to say about Creative Writing at Derby:</p>

    <p>Considerable care and attention have been devoted to ensuring that graduate employability is a central feature of the MA Creative Writing programme. When recruiting graduates, UK employers place particular emphasis on the specific skills, the professional experience and the area of degree specialisation of students; these are central and fundamental to this programme of study. Not only is the programme orientated towards employability via the prescribed module 'Working as a writer', each pathway imparts specific skills, intellectual abilities and industry-specific knowledge in order to help prepare you for publication, employment, freelance work, self-employment, or business set-up.</p>
<h5>Invaluable work experience</h5>
<p>You will all have the opportunity to engage in work experience as one of your optional modules. These opportunities are managed by the Creative Writing team in collaboration with the University's <a href=""/study/employability/"">Careers and Employment Service</a>. Guidelines describing the coordination and management of work experience are available on the Course Resources page for the programme.  They contain information on safeguarding and details the responsibilities between the programme team, CES, the provider and yourself. In addition, this module is supplemented by our Writing commission module, which gives you the opportunity to write for a specific context or publication.</p>
<h5>Transferrable skills for any workplace</h5>
<p>Following successful completion of the prescribed modules for each pathway you will have gained a broad-ranging and well-balanced understanding of the key employment functions within the areas in which writers work, from publishing your own work to publishing others’ through to employment as an arts professional. These modules progress and advance your skills and knowledge in your chosen areas and successful completion will equip you to enter more specific roles. Throughout the programme too, your transferable skills will be developed and honed. You will be challenged to think what skills you have developed and can apply in other arenas and be given the opportunity to showcase your work to potential employers.</p>
<p>Beyond seeking employment as a writer or an arts professional, you might wish to consider several other options, and your tutors and the University Careers and Employment Service will be happy to explore these with you. Freelancing, or setting up a business, for example, is a career path chosen by many. By these means, the MA Creative Writing will prepare you for a wide variety of roles and positions. The Careers and Employment Service will advise you on all of these possibilities, while the University also offers business incubation units for graduates.</p>

<p>Our MA Careers Education and Coaching provides an ideal stepping stone for anyone seeking to enter the career development profession. It should be especially valuable for recent graduates who have studied subjects such as Education, Sociology, Psychology and Social Work and for individuals who are already employed in a variety of relevant roles and settings.</p>
<h3>Combine your masters with a professional qualification</h3>
<p>This course brings together a highly regarded masters qualification and initial professional training in career guidance. If you are studying on a full-time basis, it means you can achieve both in just one year.</p>
<p>Your studies will incorporate the Qualification in Career Development (QCD) which is awarded by the Career Development Institute (CDI) and is the premier route to achieving registered career professional status.</p>
<p>Throughout the course, we will assist you to collate evidence into a portfolio which will be used by CDI moderators to review your achievements against the required standards for professional practice.</p>
<p>Our staff will support you through this process and coach you to develop your own practice. They are on the CDI register of practitioners, so fully qualified to help you work towards this award.</p>
<h3><strong>Broaden your knowledge and experience</strong></h3>
<p>This is a broad-based course rooted in practice and integrating various approaches to providing career support, including career guidance, career coaching and career education.</p>
<p>Your studies will be aligned with contemporary thinking about the skills base needed by today’s careers professionals. You will explore the way the language of career education and coaching is used and focus on how to harness technology to deliver career development interventions.</p>
<h3><strong>Gain practical skills on placement</strong></h3>
<p>We use the workplace as both a context and a resource for your learning. The CDI requires candidates to undertake 20 days of relevant work-based placements and a further ten days of related work-based learning, including activities such as attending career fairs and going on visits to employers.</p>
<p>If you are already in relevant employment, you can use activities within your own workplace to help you fulfil the CDI requirements. However, we encourage all our students to explore a range of delivery contexts in different settings. Our team will support you to locate and secure suitable opportunities for your work placements.</p>
<p>Thanks to our extensive networks of career development providers locally, nationally and internationally, we can give you access to workplaces as diverse as schools, colleges, universities, research centres, large employers and sector bodies. This will give you insights into the broad range of roles undertaken by career development practitioners, including human resource management and talent management.</p>
<h3><strong>Cutting-edge research</strong></h3>
<p>This course places you at the forefront of latest thinking in careers education and coaching. You will gain vital research skills and undertake your own work-based research project on a theme of your choice.</p>
<p>To support this project, you will benefit from exciting opportunities to be associated with our <a href=""/research/centres-groups/icegs/"">International Centre for Guidance Studies</a> (iCeGS) and to work alongside high-profile researchers who are breaking new ground in the discipline of career development.</p>
<p>Established in 1988, iCeGS conducts research, provides consultancy to the career sector, and delivers accredited learning programmes up to and including doctoral level. It has built an international reputation, with expert staff recognised as thought leaders and influencers in the field of career development and employability. </p>
<p>Along with access to these experts who will teach you throughout the programme, you can take full advantage of the iCeGS library and archive of career literature and research. You can also take part in extra-curricular activities such as the iCeGS annual lecture, research seminars and workshops to broaden your knowledge and your professional networks.</p>
<h3><strong>Flexibility and convenience</strong></h3>
<p>We have designed this course to help you balance your studies with your other commitments. This is especially important if you are in employment and working towards your masters on a part-time basis.</p>
<p>The course is delivered in ways which ensure maximum flexibility, including a blended learning approach and face-to-face teaching which avoids term times and includes weekend lectures and workshops, plus block teaching during the school holidays.</p>

    <p>Highly sought after due to their financial and business acumen, quantity surveyors often hold very senior positions in industry, local government and central government. You will find that career opportunities also exist in a number of related fields, including the built environment, civil and heavy engineering and the offshore and petrochemical industries.</p>
<p>Quantity surveyors are responsible for the cost of any building project - from initial estimates right through to the final acquisition of materials. Surveying jobs and their associated roles are varied, but generally focussed on providing clients with value for money while adhering to the strict regulations which govern every aspect of the construction industry.</p>
<p>Day-to-day responsibilities include roles inside the office, on the construction site or in meetings with clients and other project personnel. While the very nature of construction work ensures that no two projects are ever the same, a typical work day might involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>preparation of contracts, including details regarding the quantities of required materials</li>
<li>on-going cost analysis of maintenance and repair work</li>
<li>feasibility studies of client requests</li>
<li>analysing completed work and arranging payment to contractors</li>
<li>allocating upcoming work to contractors</li>
<li>site visits, assessments and projections for future work</li>
</ul>
<p>Quantity surveyors may choose to specialise in a specific area of the construction industry and concentrate on areas like property taxation, costing advice, maintenance of existing buildings and application to funding sources.</p>

    <p>Our intensive accelerated BA (Hons) Professional Policing course provides an alternative route for ambitious students who want to complete a pre-join policing degree in a shorter time frame than usual.

</ul>
<p><em>Please note that completion of this degree does not guarantee employment as a police officer or police staff.</em></p>
<h3><strong>Why this course?</strong></h3>
<p>As career opportunities in policing are due to grow dramatically, with the government having committed to a recruitment drive of an additional 20,000 police officers, we have become the first university in the country to introduce the accelerated route to the BA (Hons) Professional Policing.</p>
<p>This course provides the same comprehensive preparation for a policing career as our traditional three-year degree, but with the teaching condensed into two years to include tuition over the summer. It is a convenient and more affordable option if you want to progress from education to employment quickly and have both the capacity and capability to commit to a more intensive study programme.</p>
<p>We will help you develop an in-depth understanding of the role of a police officer today, including a thorough grasp of criminal justice systems and the powers and laws used by the police in England and Wales. Throughout, you will have the chance to apply theory to practice with case studies, practical scenarios, research projects and volunteering opportunities with local police forces.</p>
<h3><strong>Challenge and choice</strong></h3>
<p>The course is delivered through a combination of face-to-face teaching, work-based learning and self-directed learning, taking place over three semesters during the year instead of the traditional two. Your learning experience will be rigorous and demanding, but we offer a full range of support to help you meet the challenge and achieve your goals.</p>
<p>The final stage of the degree enables you to focus on an area of policing that particularly interests you and matches your career aspirations. For your dissertation, you will work on a real-life issue or solve a problem, currently experienced by local police forces, producing evidence-based research which can influence change within the profession and the wider community.</p>
<h3><strong>Become a Special Constable with Nottinghamshire Police</strong></h3>
<p>The BA (Hons) Professional Policing (Accelerated) includes two pathways options. You can choose the theory only route, or you can choose to apply to become a Special Constable while completing your studies, in partnership with Nottinghamshire Police. Being a Special Constable gives you invaluable practical insights into what it is like to work in a local constabulary, making you a standout candidate when applying for a role in the force. You will still follow the same high-quality curriculum as students who do not pursue this option but your experiences in the workplace will enrich your learning and stand you in good stead for the future.</p>
<p>We have partnered with Nottinghamshire Police to deliver the Special Constable route and you will need to pass the relevant vetting, assessment centre, medical and fitness procedures set by them in order to join the Special Constable route.</p>

    <p>Product Design at Derby is aimed at creative people who may have studied Art and Design or Design Technology at school or developed a passion for the subject since leaving formal education. We will help you to build on your creativity and develop an understanding of the reality of design for manufacture. Because we teach in small groups we can help you to develop your potential as an individual and support your personal enthusiasm for design.</p>
<p>We recognise that the role of the Product Designer is constantly evolving along with the way that products are produced and consumed. You will be exposed to a wide range of potential outcomes encompassing traditional mass manufacturing and the current trend towards maker culture which is centred on a more individual approach. This is reflected both in the teaching and the facilities that we offer.</p>
<p>You'll focus developing your creativity and practical skills that employers tell us they want from graduates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Industry sponsored assignments</li>
<li>Group projects</li>
<li>Knowledge of the latest technologies in CAD, visualisation and rapid prototyping</li>
</ul>
<h3>Choose a BA or BSc route</h3>
<p>This course has been designed to give you the option to tailor it to match your personal interests. There is a common first year for all product design students, after which you can choose whether to focus on a BA (Hons) or BSc (Hons) pathway. </p>
<p>If you don't have the appropriate qualifications to start this course, you can study the <a href=""/undergraduate/year-zero-arts/"">Year Zero - Arts</a> programme for a year first. </p>
<p>You'll study at Markeaton Street and work in studios and workshops, running alongside advanced computer based systems, to develop the traditional design skills and creative processes that employers say are relevant in a modern design environment.</p>
<p>Our previous programme leader, Terry Watson, contributed to an <a href=""https://www.independent.co.uk/student/UWE/some-grand-designs-for-life-a6811781.html"">article in The Independent</a> exploring the benefits of a degree in product design. </p>

    <p>Our graduates have shown that there is a wealth of career opportunities available to product designers, in the UK and abroad. This course will give you the skills and knowledge you need to start your career, both in the product design profession and in related areas.</p>
<p>You can go on an optional work placement between stages two and three, which is a fantastic opportunity to gain some real experience of working in the industry. You'll also gain an additional qualification - the Diploma in Professional Practice. <a href=""/services/centre-for-excellence-learning-teaching/inclusive-practice/"">Find out more about placements</a></p>
<p>Every year we select graduates to showcase their work at the New Designers exhibition which is a great opportunity to network and make vital industry contacts.</p>
<p><a href=""/study/employability/"">Employable graduates</a> – we’re ranked 15th highest amongst all UK universities and 12th for English institutions with 96% of graduates in work or further study within six months of completing their degree.</p>
<p>Graduate Sam Johnson landed a dream job at Lego, and is now an established designer, here's what he had to say about the course: “Studying the course at the University of Derby helped me develop a very good understanding of the design process and CAD software. Plus I learned new skills in drawing, rendering and presentation which resulted in me landing my childhood dream job as Junior Designer with Lego after graduation.”</p>

    <p>We equip you with highly transferable skills in loss prevention, investigatory practice and investigative interviewing which will give you a broad career scope. Because the degree is designed in close partnership with constabularies, it is an excellent stepping stone if you want to pursue a career in the policing family once you have graduated. You could, however, consider other roles in the broader criminal justice system, civilian investigation, retail investigation, business crime investigation, crime reduction partnerships, security and loss prevention.</p>
<p>Our Careers and Employment Service will provide you with support from day one of your course to ensure you leave Derby as a ‘work-ready’ graduate – industry aware, motivated and enterprising. Throughout your studies, you’ll also benefit from our Personal Development Planning (PDP) scheme which enables you to reflect on your learning and develop your career ambitions.</p>
<p>The support continues once you’ve completed your course too: you are entitled to further help and guidance from the Careers and Employment Service for up to three years after leaving the University.</p>
<h3>Further study</h3>
<p>You can go on to postgraduate study at Derby, with MSc qualifications in subjects such as <a href=""/postgraduate/criminology-policing-courses/criminal-investigation-msc/"">Criminal Investigation</a>, <a href=""/postgraduate/criminology-policing-courses/criminal-justice-and-criminology-msc/"">Criminal Justice and Criminology</a>, and <a href=""/postgraduate/criminology-policing-courses/police-leadership-strategy-organisation-msc/"">Police Leadership, Strategy and Organisation</a>. These expand your knowledge into specialist areas and accelerate your progression to more senior and leadership roles.</p>
<p class=""feature-block"">“I was immediately drawn to this particular course as I felt it coincided with both my professional and research interests. As someone who already works in practice, I was impressed to see that the course could be tailored for someone who is employed, allowing me a flexible approach to my studies.” Alan Harrop, MSc Criminal Justice and Criminology.</p>
<p>As a graduate of the University of Derby, you can benefit from a <a href=""/postgraduate/fees-and-finance/alumni-discount/"">25% Alumni discount</a> on your postgraduate course fees. Terms and conditions apply.</p>

<p>“High standards of nurse education are absolutely pivotal to the quality of care we provide. We know that the nurses the University of Derby delivers are first class and we want to recruit the people that it trains.” <strong>Gavin Boyle, Chief Executive at Derby Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust</strong></p>
<p>If you already hold a degree and are looking to qualify as a nurse, find out more about our <a href=""/postgraduate/nursing-health-care-practice-courses/nursing-adult-msc/"">MSc Nursing (Adult).</a></p>
<h4>Nursing is challenging, satisfying and life-changing. This highly respected course represents your first step into a profession it is a privilege to join.</h4>
<h4>The ideal preparation for your career</h4>
<p>We have a strong track record in providing high-quality and innovative nurse education. We help you develop an in-depth understanding of the demands and rewards of the role so that you are fully prepared to work with adult patients who have diverse, acute and chronic conditions. </p>
<p>Alongside substantial time spent on clinical placement, you’ll cover the core themes of biological sciences; pharmacology studies; the sociological aspects of health care; leadership and management; professional, legal and ethical studies; evidence-based practice and research; and integrated practice.</p>
<p>Because this course is accredited by the <a href=""https://www.nmc.org.uk/"">Nursing and Midwifery Council</a>, you will be eligible to register and practise as a nurse as soon as you graduate, as long as you meet the <a href=""https://www.nmc.org.uk/"">NMC’s requirements</a>.</p>
<h4>Hands-on experience of the profession</h4>
<p>Practical experience is a cornerstone of this degree. Drawing on our extensive links with the NHS and other local employers, you’ll hone your skills on a wide variety of placements, including hospitals, acute settings, community and voluntary organisations, and the independent sector.</p>
<p>This is essential to your preparation for registration, taking up approximately half of your time on the course. You’ll take part in 24-hour care with shift patterns so you gain a genuine feel for the practicalities and demands of the profession.</p>
<p>Your clinical placement hours will be completed in settings carefully selected by the University in association with the NHS Trusts. Throughout, you’ll benefit from the support of approved and qualified mentors who will help you get as much out of the experience as possible.</p>
<p>There may even be the opportunity to head overseas for work experience. In 2016, six of our students spent a month on placement in Kerala, India, to gain insights into a different healthcare system and culture.</p>
<h4>First-class facilities in Derby and Chesterfield</h4>
<p>You can take this course at our <a href=""/life/our-campuses/derby/"">Derby Campus</a> or our new <a href=""https://www.derby.ac.uk/life/our-campuses/chesterfield/"" target=""_blank"">Chesterfield Site</a>. Both offer outstanding <a href=""/study/facilities/"">learning environments</a> including clinical skills suites built to professional standards, with replica wards, counselling rooms and treatment rooms fully equipped with the latest clinical resources.</p>
<p>An exciting new addition is a state-of-the-art <a href=""/study/facilities/immersive-suite/"">Immersive Suite</a> which creates a simulated environment for practising your skills in a realistic setting. The first university facility of its kind outside London, the suite replicates the atmosphere, sights and sounds of, for instance, the inside of an ambulance, a busy A&amp;E ward or an operating theatre so you can gain a greater understanding of clinical decision-making in action. Immersive suites are available at both campuses.</p>
<h4>A dynamic learning experience</h4>
<p>We enrich your studies with exciting opportunities to take part in special projects, conferences, awards schemes and national NHS initiatives. Some students were, for instance, selected to become Care Maker Champions to spread the word about compassion in practice in the NHS. Our groups regularly take part in public health initiatives too, promoting imaginative measures to encourage healthier lifestyles.</p>
<p>We hold showcase events where you can demonstrate the skills you are developing on the course and some students even present their ideas for service improvements at high-profile conferences. We have an impressive track record in schemes such as the Student Nursing Times Awards too.</p>
<h4>Expertise to inspire you</h4>
<p>You’ll be taught by enthusiastic and dedicated staff who are immersed in their areas of practice and committed to supporting you at every stage of your studies. Some continue to work in practice alongside their teaching role.</p>
<p>Our <a href=""/research/centres-groups/health-and-social-care-research-centre/"">Health and Social Care Research Centre</a> spearheads a range of projects aimed at building healthy, sustainable communities. This gives you access to up-to-date knowledge and latest thinking relevant to your career. Our team includes renowned professionals whose work features regularly in leading journals and books and who help shape national policies.</p>
<h4>In tune with latest developments</h4>
<p>This course is closely mapped against the needs of employers, which will ensure that your learning is up to date and relevant. In delivering the programme, we respond to national changes such as latest government policies. As a result, some of the information about the course may change. </p>
<p>As health care is increasingly delivered by multi-professional teams, we offer opportunities at each stage of the course for you to learn with, and from, students from other disciplines. This is really important in preparing you to work in more flexible ways after graduation. By learning to work together, you can help achieve the best outcomes for your patients.</p>
<h4>Financial support to help you succeed</h4>
<p>Don’t let financial concerns get in the way of your ambitions. As an applicant for this course, you will be able to access a support package of tuition fee loans and support for your living costs.</p>
<p>You won’t have to pay any money upfront: tuition and living cost loans work just like a tax on your earnings rather than a commercial or payday loan. You will only start paying back the loans when you are earning above £25,000 per year and will pay 9% of any income above £25,000. </p>
<p>You can also secure grants – which do not have to be repaid – to cover childcare and the costs of travelling to your placement.</p>

</ul>

    <p>Playing a critical role in the UK’s creative economy, the music industry is undergoing dramatic change. New digital distribution models are emerging, live events are rocketing in popularity, and exciting new ways of music-making are constantly evolving. It means that professionals specialising in music technology and production are in greater demand than ever before – in the UK and overseas.   </p>
<p>Sound and music technology is important in almost every aspect of the entertainment industry. Sound recordists, music producers, audio engineers, broadcasters, musicians, composers, film-makers, computer game designers and sound designers all use music technology in some form or other. Our graduates have progressed into many fields of professional activity including production and studio work, outside broadcast management and web design.  </p>

<h3>Reasons to choose this top-up degree</h3>

<p>Our course delves deeply into the workings of international financial markets and international business strategy. You will learn how businesses use financial assets in their global activities and how they are affected by changes in the markets.</p>
<p>You will also develop the broader abilities which employers value, including problem-solving, decision-making, analysis, report-writing and presentation skills. When you graduate, you will join our network of alumni worldwide – ideally prepared for an influential career in today’s increasingly internationalised and dynamic business environment.</p>

They are supported by industry experts, including our Visiting Professor of Banking and Financial Economics, Professor Trevor Williams, formerly Chief Economist at Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking.</p>

    <p>The course is for anyone who is inspired and moved by interiors and inquisitive enough to find out how to realise these technically. Studying interior design at Derby will help you develop your design skills to create functional and unique spaces with strong spatial identities. You’ll learn how to best use specific spatial qualities, i.e. forms, texture and materials, lighting, colour, architectural components, objects and placement of these, enabling you to make your ideas become a reality. You’ll be inspired to work in a way that is environmentally responsible, memorable and experiential.</p>
<p>If you don't have the appropriate qualifications to start this course, you can study the <a href=""/undergraduate/year-zero-arts/"">Year Zero - Arts</a> programme for a year first. </p>
<h3>Preparing you for a career in interior design</h3>
<p>The roles and responsibilities of an Interior Designer will see you become involved from the initial brief to the final build of a project which could be an existing building, an urban interior or a self-standing entity such as an exhibition or set-stage. The course is dynamic and co-creative, in that it welcomes students’ own voices/cultures and values risk-taking and experimentation. It further aims to equip students with all the relevant skills and knowledge ready for the ‘real’ world upon graduation.</p>
<p>You will gain exposure to the wide field that is interior design, exploring various spatial typologies such as residential interiors, commercial interiors i.e. retail, corporate, set-stage and exhibition design and hospitality, as well as exploring adaptive reuse/regenerative design to name but a few, with a focus on employment opportunities open to an interior design graduate. You will also learn how to collaborate nationally/internationally, and design bespoke artefacts and furniture to compliment your interiors and generate the appropriate visual documentation required for each stage of the design. You will also get to understand how people relate to space and objects, by being exposed to ergonomics, and learn to design spaces that are functional and in accordance to building regulations and health and safety legislation.</p>

<a id=""d.en.24246""></a>
    
    <p>A key aim of this programme is to prepare you as a graduate for the professional world of interior designers and we would anticipate that a number of you will seek to pursue your career through either freelance or consultancy practice drawing on the opportunities presented through the curriculum to collaborate with other design-related disciplines.</p>
<p>This course will provide you with an opportunity to examine different sectors within the commercial and residential interior design, enabling you to gain an understanding and appreciation of the many facets and opportunities that are open to an interior design graduate. </p>
<p>After graduation you’ll be prepared for a career in interior design with endless opportunities to choose from such as:</p>

</ul>
<p>As organisations become ever more dependent on information technology to operate efficiently and effectively, our BSc (Hons) Information Technology primes you for exciting career opportunities in any sector, anywhere in the world.</p>
<h3><strong>Meeting employers’ needs – for today and tomorrow</strong></h3>
<p>The BSc (Hons) Information Technology covers two key themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data Analysis, Big Data and Internet of Things (IoT)</li>
<li>UX (User Experience) and User Centred Design</li>
</ul>
<p>These themes are supported and enhanced as you study a range of closely related computing and business topics.</p>
<p>The course captures how our modern global society and the developing world are increasingly reliant on IT products and services. Mass-market consumer products, such as smart and mobile devices, are harnessing the almost seamless integration of small, portable, easy-to-use IoT devices with access to the World Wide Web and wireless communication technology. This ensures access to vast quantities of information almost anywhere – and the ‘Big Data’ generated by the use of such products can be exploited to help make sound business decisions and to contribute to wider public benefit. </p>

<p>Studio study will be complemented with history and theory modules which will enhance your intellectual development, graduate and academic skills, whilst providing an awareness of wider contexts pertinent to illustration.</p>

    <p>Graphic design is seen, felt and experienced everywhere. Once focused on objects, graphic design is now increasingly concerned with contexts. Graphic designers inform, confront, persuade, entertain, provoke, challenge, question, direct and engage with the political, social and environmental issues of the world we live in.</p>
<p>The aim of the graphic design programme is to create passionate, creative, resourceful, entrepreneurial and adaptive problem-finders, who are prepared both technically and intellectually to embrace and exploit the opportunities that graphic design offers in the 21st Century.</p>
<p>Being a graphic designer is fun, stimulating and inspiring. Designers are creative problem-finders and solvers. You will be challenged to think differently, even professional designers are constantly developing their skills. There are always new trends, new technologies, new ideas, and new sources of inspiration – a creative mind never stops learning. It is more than just a job – it's a way of life.</p>
<p>The course is studio based, practical, hands-on and creative. It offers you many different ways to make graphic design work as you explore the different contexts and formats in which graphic design is experienced. It allows you to decide what kind of designer you want to be. It will test and challenge you to expand your understanding and knowledge of what graphic design is, what it can do and what it is for.</p>
<p>You will be introduced to typography and layout, drawing as observation and problem solving, identity and branding, packaging and point of purchase, exhibition design, publication and printing, and digital moving image. The course has a great resource base for you to use. Typically our students work on Apple Macs in computer labs, and in the Digital Print Hub you will be able to access (under guidance) high quality printing on many different types of materials, laser-cutting, book-binding, and other printing options, including screen print and Letterpress print in our Printing Studios.</p>
<p>Last year our second year students worked on live projects and competitions including a collaborative project with Derby Museum to make new interpretive tools for their archaeology gallery. Third year students were briefed by the Royal Society of Arts (RSA) at Markeaton Street, for the RSA Student Design Awards. The RSA student briefs tackle social engagement and allow students to explore graphic design solutions for real world issues. And students from graphic design and illustration were shortlisted for the prestigious Penguin Student Design Awards.</p>
<p>We understand how important it is to have the professional skills that you need to make the transition from University to employment. So we have a professional practice module in the second year that is all about researching the industry, meeting designers and studios, building design networks, identifying your strengths and promoting yourself as a graphic designer. This work has helped our students prepare for graduate life, with 93.8% of our students being in graduate level destinations within six months of completing this course (HESA 2016). </p>
<p>If you don't have the appropriate qualifications to start this course, you can study the <a href=""/undergraduate/year-zero-arts/"">Year Zero - Arts</a> programme for a year first. </p>

    <p><strong>This course will help you develop fashion design skills, and expand your knowledge of key business aspects through a combination of creative and practical study. </strong></p>
<p>The core purpose of fashion marketing is to supply, disseminate and manage information regarding a brand, company or individual to the public and press.</p>
<p>The course is for anyone wishing to be both creative and strategic. It will help you develop fashion design skills, and expand your knowledge of key business aspects through a combination of creative and practical study.<strong> </strong>It is designed for those who want to learn about the business of fashion but have a desire to design and make. Ultimately, this course is for anyone wishing to pursue a fashion marketing career.</p>
<p>You'll gain a valuable insight into the commercial elements of the fashion sector, from an integrated perspective encapsulating emerging fashion design and marketing concepts. This new programme of study incorporates expertise from the BA (Hons) Fashion Design programme, creating an integrated programme of study encouraging 'bespoke' approaches to personal study. </p>
<p>In stage one you’ll be introduced to the fundamentals of fashion design practice and market sensing, for the ready-to-wear market. In stage two there is a greater emphasis on the commercial world, with a focus on branding and influencing. You will also be encouraged to participate in national and international competitions – several of our recent students have won national competitions over the past few years. Stage three provides a unique opportunity for you to advance your thinking and practice, through a self-managed process of risk taking, experimentation and resolution. Modules dedicated to business and entrepreneurship correctly position these activities with a commercial context.  </p>
<p>We encourage all second years to take a work placement in industry, which will also give you an additional qualification - the Diploma in Professional Practice. Placements are sometimes hard work but give you fantastic experience and are deeply rewarding. We have previously had students placed at a wide variety of companies including, Marks &amp; Spencer, Temperley London, Erdem, Mother of Pearl, Preen, Aitor Throup, Tommy Hilfiger and Roksanda, amongst others.</p>

<h3>A powerful combination</h3>
<p>Both electrical and electronic engineering depend on the same fundamental scientific laws but diverge widely beyond these basics.</p>
<p>In electrical engineering, our focus is on how electricity can be used to transport and deliver energy. It lights our homes, runs many of our domestic gadgets, and keeps the wheels of industry turning. It is such an established and reliable part of our lives that we take it for granted all too often, yet it remains a fascinating and developing field of study. Electrical engineering deals with the study of motors and generators and their control, power transmission and distribution systems, and the principles that underlie them. </p>
<p>In electronic engineering, we look at how electricity is applied to carry, process and store information. This is the driving force behind today's information revolution and forms the basis of everyday devices like the mobile phone and the computer, as well as a huge range of systems used in commerce and industry. Electronics depends heavily on semiconductor technology, which has led to the invention of the famous microchip.</p>

<p>Economics graduates with an understanding of business and leadership are in great demand across the public, private and voluntary sectors worldwide.

    <p>You can choose from two pathways; BSc (Hons) Computer Science (Software Development) or BSc (Hons) Computer Science (Networks and Security) pathway.</p>
<p>Our Computer Science degree with a Software Development pathway or a Networks and Security pathway is highly technical with a strong focus on the most important skills within the subject areas. Our Software Development pathway focuses on computer programming, with an emphasis on practical techniques underpinned by theory and informed by research. The Networks and Security pathway is based on a recognised industrial certification in Networks. There is a common first year with specialist modules in your second and final year – this approach gives you the time to understand which area you’re interested in most to help you decide which pathway to choose at the end of your first year.</p>
<p>In Computer Science (Software Development) you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Harness cutting-edge software development tools in our industry-standard laboratories</li>
<li>Learn from experienced computer scientists who have strong industry links</li>
</ul>
<p>In Computer Science (Networks and Security) you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Study an industry-recognised CISCO Certified Network Associate syllabus</li>
<li>Learn from experienced computer network specialists and ex-industry professionals</li>

    <p>Whichever pathway you choose, you'll find that your advanced skills in software development or networks and security are in high demand. </p>
<p>The majority of computing jobs require software development abilities and experience. So whether you want to be a software engineer, project manager, technical architect or chief technology officer, the Software Development pathway will help you get there.</p>
<p>If you graduate from the Networks and Security pathway, you will be suited to roles that involve developing, maintaining, securing and managing computer networks, as well as jobs that involve the engineering side of network protocol development and research. Careers include Network Specialist, Network Administrator, Network Technician, Network Analyst and Network Engineer.</p>
<p>However, this degree will equip you with wide-ranging skills, which could lead on to many different careers in the computing field and beyond. For instance, your numerical and analytical skills will be very strong, and you should also be good at teamwork and project management.</p>

<p>Our BSc (Hons) Child and Family Health and Wellbeing is your stepping stone to a role where you can make a positive difference every working day. You’ll be part of a new generation of dedicated, creative and highly capable professionals supporting children, families and their wider communities.</p>
<h3 class=""p1"">A vital role in society</h3>
<p class=""p1"">This course is ideal for anyone interested in helping families and children to reach their potential. We will equip you with the skills, understanding and values you need to work in a broad range of settings delivering health, social and developmental work.</p>
<p class=""p1"">You will learn how to provide high-quality support services which are critical to sustaining family life, sometimes in the face of problems such as poverty, illness, domestic violence and mental health issues. We help you to support vulnerable families with respect and compassion, promoting strong parenting skills and healthier lifestyles.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Throughout, you will take a holistic view of children’s and young people’s needs – emotionally, socially, educationally and from health perspectives. You will also consider those needs in the context of the wider community.</p>
<h3 class=""p1"">Ensuring you are work-ready</h3>
<p>Ours is a highly vocational degree where you will be treated as a professional worker in training. We help you meet demanding standards so that you can hit the ground running from day one in your career.</p>
<p>The focus is on applying your skills to practical scenarios. You will find yourself writing up home visit reports, devising family learning resources such as games, and harnessing music, dance or drama to help children express themselves creatively.</p>
<p>With family support workers frequently on the frontline of tackling crucial public health concerns, you will also work on practical projects covering everything from healthy eating and exercise to children’s dental health.</p>
<h3>Advanced knowledge, practical research</h3>
<p>Because it leads to a BSc qualification, this degree sets you apart from graduates of other Child and Family Health courses. We place a strong emphasis on scientific knowledge in areas such as health psychology to enhance your professional credibility.</p>
<p>Another distinctive feature is a focus on primary research. In your second year, you build your practical skills in research methods. You then go on to complete a major research study in your final year, covering a theme of your choice and centred on actual workplace practice.</p>
<p>Your experience of research, data collection and analysis will help raise your profile as a critical, independent thinker. It will give you the confidence and capacity to lead change in the workplace, based on strong evidence.</p>
<h3>Gain practical experience on placement</h3>
<p class=""p1"">In your final year, you undertake a placement working in health and wellbeing settings. It could be with a family support team, social work team, children’s centre, hospital, school or voluntary organisation.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Because strong inter-personal and communication skills are essential to your career success, you will gain meaningful experience of building positive relationships with children, families and other practitioners.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In earlier stages of the course you are also encouraged and supported to undertake voluntary work in relevant settings to prepare for your placement.</p>
<h3 class=""p1"">Strong professional partnerships to inspire you</h3>
<p class=""p1"">This course has been designed in partnership with employers across the health and social care sector. We liaise closely with professionals ranging from children’s centre managers to health promotion workers to ensure that your learning is up to date, relevant and purposeful.</p>
<p class=""p1"">You will hear from a wide variety of specialist guest speakers. Some focus on specific themes like domestic violence, safeguarding or the Prevent agenda. Others share insights from their own experiences in roles such as health visitor, family support worker or social worker.</p>
<h3>Working together to learn from each other</h3>
<p>Successful professionals who work with children and families have to be adaptable, versatile and resilient, prepared to work with other professionals in multi-agency teams. You will therefore have opportunities to learn with, and from, students from other disciplines through our College of Health and Social Care's Inter-Professional Learning agenda. This is very important in preparing you to work alongside other practitioners after graduation.</p>
<h3>Outstanding learning facilities</h3>
<p>You can take this course at our <a href=""https://www.derby.ac.uk/life/our-campuses/derby/"">Derby Campus</a> offer outstanding <a href=""https://www.derby.ac.uk/study/facilities/"">learning environments</a> including clinical skills suites built to professional standards, with replica wards, counselling rooms and treatment rooms fully equipped with the latest clinical resources.</p>

    <h3>The highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li>The course focuses on developing your practical laboratory skills, so you'll gain first-hand experience of lab work from year one</li>
<li>You'll also spend time honing your interpersonal skills and general employability, so you can move on to a diverse range of careers in clinical and public health laboratories, industry and research settings</li>
<li>We are currently seeking accreditation for this course from the <a href=""https://www.ibms.org/home/"">Institute of Biomedical Science</a>. Upon successful accreditation, the degree will fast-track your journey towards registration as a biomedical scientist with the Health and Care Professions Council</li>
<li>All of our teaching team are active researchers as well as teachers, so they will be able to share some of the latest findings and innovative thinking from the human health field</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a progressive, challenging course which focuses on the latest advances in medical research aimed at preventing ill health and prolonging life. The devastating COVID-19 pandemic has increased demand for skills in this area, so this degree is highly relevant right now and you can expect to have strong career prospects.</p>
<p>Biomedical Science is a broad discipline of modern medical science. It is all about understanding human health and the diseases that affect the normal processes in the human body, including their diagnosis. On this degree you'll gain the skills and knowledge to understand the operation of human organisms through subjects like clinical chemistry, immunology, microbiology, histology, clinical genetics, molecular biology, pathology and cancer biology.</p>
<h3>Training you for research</h3>
<p>During the programme, you will gain an understanding of biomedical investigations, diagnosis, monitoring and disease treatment. There's a strong focus on laboratory research and you will gain first-hand experience of this from year one. You will have access to a student research laboratory and regularly get the chance to conduct scientific investigations — sometimes in a group and sometimes on your own. You will also need to report your findings to others, including at a student conference attended by employers.</p>
<p>As well as giving you this practical experience, we will of course teach you the essential underpinning knowledge around research governance, ethics, and good scientific practice. In your final year, you will have the opportunity to demonstrate the research skills you have amassed, with an independent study into an area of your choice. This will be a lab-based study or one that uses clinical data.</p>

    <p>You will graduate with skills that put you at the forefront of advances in medical health.

    <h3>The University of Derby Leads the Way</h3>
<p>From September 2018, The University of Derby will be one of only four Universities in the country to offer graduate level practitioner competencies for students studying BA (Hons) Early Childhood Studies from Stage 1 of the degree.</p>
<p>The Competencies have been developed by members of the Early Childhood Studies Degrees Network (ECSDN) in consultation with students and employers, with an aim of <em>‘strengthening a graduate-led Early Childhood workforce that is responsive to workforce needs and improves outcomes for children’ </em>(ECSDN, 2018). </p>
<p>Students that achieve the Early Childhood Graduate Practitioner competencies will meet the nine competencies through assessed observations of practice, practice-based tasks and academic assessment.</p>
<p>The Early Childhood Graduate Competencies are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Advocating for young children’s rights and participation</li>
<li>Promote holistic child development</li>
<li>Work directly with young children, families and colleagues to promote health, well-being, safety and nurturing care</li>
<li>Observe, listen and plan for young children to support their well-being, early learning, progression and transitions</li>
<li>Safeguarding and child protection</li>
<li>Inclusive practice</li>
<li>Partnership with parents and caregivers</li>
<li>Collaborating with others</li>
<li>Professional development</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p class=""feature-block""><em>'We are delighted to have been part of the development of these competencies and to be able to offer our students this important opportunity. These developments will enhance reflective practice, graduate employability and the progression onto post-graduate study. </em><em>The Early Childhood Competencies will not only serve to strengthen the practice of our students and their critical application of theory to practice but will also make an important contribution towards meeting our on-going aim of building a graduate led workforce for children and families.'  </em>Carol Fenton and Helen Simmons, Programme Leaders: BA (Hons) Early Childhood Studies</p>

    <p>This degree is your chance to shape and influence many young lives. Early childhood roles are a rapidly growing area of employment in the UK – opening doors to stimulating careers in the independent, private, public or voluntary sectors.</p>
<p>Well qualified and dedicated early childhood professionals are in demand across health, education and social care settings. Our graduates are now enjoying successful careers as early years practitioners and managers. You’ll also find there are ample opportunities for promotion and progression to leadership positions in children’s services.</p>

    <h3>The highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li>Join one of the best business management degrees in the UK — we've been ranked in the Top 20 for two years running (Guardian University Guide 2021).</li>
<li>We're looking for students who want to 'do' business, as well as learn about business — is that you? From the get-go, you'll be thinking about how to apply what you're learning, through topical case studies, business simulations, real consultancy projects and work placements. </li>
<li>Spend the first year covering all aspects of business management to find out where your passions and talents lie.</li>
<li>From year two, you can continue on a general Business Management pathway or choose one of the following:
<ul>
<li>Business Management (Business Technology)</li>
<li>Business Management (Enterprise)</li>
<li>Business Management (Finance)</li>
<li>Business Management (Human Resource Management)</li>
<li>Business Management (Marketing)</li>
<li>Business Management (Supply Chain and Logistics)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All pathways are accredited by the <a href=""https://www.managers.org.uk/"">Chartered Management Institute</a>, which means you gain an extra professional qualification on top of your degree as well as professional mentoring and access to CMI member benefits.</li>
<li>Most of the specialist pathways are also approved by other professional bodies — <a href=""https://www.cim.co.uk/"">CIM</a>, <a href=""https://www.cimaglobal.com/"">CIMA</a> and <a href=""https://www.cipd.co.uk/"">CIPD</a> — giving you extra credibility and exemptions from future professional exams.</li>
</ul>

<a id=""d.en.102631""></a>
    
    <p>By the end of the course you will have sound business acumen and a wide range of practical skills. You’ll graduate with not only a degree in Business Management, but with an extra professional qualification (the CMI Diploma) and a host of real-world experience, so you’ll already have a head start in the careers market.</p>
<p>If you opted for a specialist pathway, you will have deeper knowledge in a particular field and if that pathway had extra accreditation, you'll also be able to complete some professional exams quicker.</p>
<p>Because this is such a broad degree, lots of different job roles will be open to you, in areas such as project management, analysis, consultancy, accountancy, operations, human resource management, marketing, sales, logistics and finance. Previous students have gone on to work for prominent employers — including Deloitte, PwC, Capita, the BBC, DHL, Barclays, Tata, Mott MacDonald and IBM — while others have set up their own businesses. </p>
<p>Our <a href=""http://www.derby.ac.uk/study/careers/"">Careers and Employment Service</a> will provide you with support from day one of your course to ensure you leave Derby as a ‘work-ready’ graduate – industry aware, motivated and enterprising. Throughout your studies, you’ll also benefit from our Personal Development Planning (PDP) scheme which enables you to reflect on your learning and develop your career ambitions. </p>
<p>The support continues once you’ve completed your course too: you are entitled to further help and guidance from the Careers and Employment Service for up to three years after leaving our University.</p>

    <h3 style=""display: inline !important;"">Take your career in health and social care further, faster – by combining your working role with studying towards a nationally recognised qualification.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Join a course designed specifically for those working in clinical support and assistant practitioner roles</li>
<li>Benefit from flexible work-based learning, attending University on a day release basis and applying what you learn in your workplace</li>
<li>Learn from a highly experienced and enthusiastic teaching team who provide full support to help you achieve your ambitions</li>
<li>Share insights and experiences with students from other disciplines so that you are well prepared to work in multi-professional teams</li>
<li>Gain an up-to-date picture of latest developments and policies in health and social care</li>
<li>Build an excellent platform for career progression and further study at higher education level</li>
<li>Study a course that recieved 100% satisfaction in the 2017 National Student Survey</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that you will need the support of your employer to study this programme.</p>
<p>This course will help you achieve a higher level of knowledge, skills and attributes to enhance your performance in your current job and pave the way to more senior roles. It represents a partnership between you as a learner, your employer and the University. </p>
<h3>The best of both worlds</h3>
<p>You will benefit from all the advantages of work-based learning – gaining a relevant, nationally recognised qualification while continuing to work and earn as part of a healthcare team.</p>
<p>You will need the support of your employer before you can embark on your studies. You will attend the University on a day release basis to gain the theoretical knowledge which will underpin your day-to-day practice and equip you with new skills to take back into your workplace.</p>
<p>The FdSc has been designed in close collaboration with our partner employers – including hospitals, health care trusts, local authorities and social care providers – to help them build a skilled, sustainable workforce for the future and ensure the best outcomes for patients and service users. </p>
<h3>A broad base of knowledge</h3>
<p>We ensure your learning is relevant, up to date and meaningful, always linked to the delivery of compassionate care in practice. As well as developing skills specific to your own workplace setting, you will gain insights into latest thinking and policies shaping how the NHS, health and social care sectors are managed and organised in the UK today.</p>
<p>We also foster your development as a reflective practitioner, helping you to identify future career and educational opportunities and to assess your continuing professional development (CPD) needs.</p>
<h3>Inter-professional learning in action</h3>
<p>This course brings together students who are working in a wide variety of roles within health and social care. They have experience in areas ranging from general and community nursing, radiography, occupational therapy and operating theatre practice through to rehabilitation, social care, primary care, paediatrics, mental health and learning disabilities, plus many more.</p>
<p>Because health care is increasingly delivered by multi professional teams, one of the major advantages of this course is that you will be learning with, and from, students from other health and social care disciplines. Sharing ideas and insights will be a key part of your learning experience. This is also vital in preparing you to work in more flexible and collaborative ways after your studies.</p>
<h3>A dynamic learning experience</h3>
<p>We offer an outstanding learning environment. Alongside well-resourced teaching rooms, our facilities at the Derby campus include a clinical skills suite built to professional standards, with replica wards, counselling rooms and treatment rooms. An exciting new addition is a state-of-the-art <a href=""/study/facilities/immersive-suite/"">Immersive Suite</a> which enables you to practise your skills in a realistic setting.</p>
<h3>Expertise to inspire you</h3>
<p>You’ll be taught by enthusiastic and dedicated staff who are immersed in their areas of practice and committed to supporting you at every stage of your studies. Some continue to work in practice alongside their teaching role.</p>
<p>Our <a href=""/research/centres-groups/health-and-social-care-research-centre/"">Health and Social Care Research Centre</a> spearheads a range of projects aimed at building healthy, sustainable communities. This gives you access to up-to-date knowledge and latest thinking relevant to your career.

    <p>On successful completion of the FdSc, you will be ideally placed to take on greater responsibility and autonomy within your workplace. You could advance to more senior roles or use your skills to take your career in new directions.</p>
<p>Having tasted academic success, you may also want to progress to further study and attain additional qualifications. We offer a wide variety of opportunities for you to take your studies to the next level.</p>
<p>You could, for instance, ‘top up’ your FdSc to gain the <a href=""/undergraduate/health-social-community-work-courses/health-and-social-care-ba-hons/"">BA (Hons) Health and Social Care</a>.

    <p>Our LLB (Hons) graduates go on to take up roles as barristers, solicitors, paralegals and chartered legal executives and can be found working in private practice, the Crown Prosecution Service, the courts, law centres, the police service, local and national government.</p>
<p>Completion of the LLB represents the end of the academic stage of your training. To become a solicitor or barrister, you must then continue to complete the vocational stage of your training:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you wish to become a solicitor, you will need to complete the Legal Practice Course (LPC). Our graduates are highly sought after by solicitors’ firms because of their practical skills underpinned by academic rigour. At Derby, we offer the <a href=""/postgraduate/law-courses/llm-lpc/"">LLM LPC</a>, which equips you with both a masters qualification and the LPC.</li>
<li>If you wish to become a barrister, you must take a one-year full-time or two-year part-time Bar Professional Training Course (BPTC). Our students are particularly successful at winning substantial scholarships for the BPTC, which is testimony to the calibre of teaching we offer. Please note, we do not offer the BPTC at the University of Derby</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if you do not want to become a legal practitioner, the LLB acts as a stepping stone to careers in broader areas. Legal skills ensure you can make a strategic contribution in many professions including the civil service, investment banking, management and tax consultancy, compliance, insurance, HR, politics, town planning, construction, publishing and education. They will also prove helpful if you want to launch your own business.</p>
<p>Our Careers and Employment Service will provide you with support from day one of your course to ensure you leave Derby as a ‘work-ready’ graduate – industry aware, motivated and enterprising. Throughout your studies, you’ll also benefit from our Personal Development Planning (PDP) scheme which enables you to reflect on your learning and develop your career ambitions.</p>
<p>The support continues once you’ve completed your course too: you are entitled to further help and guidance from the Careers and Employment Service for up to three years after leaving the University.</p>

<p>If you would like to take your studies to postgraduate level, the Derby <a href=""/postgraduate/law-courses/llm/"">LLM</a> is a masters degree offering maximum flexibility, choice and opportunity.

    <p><strong>History is a subject for anyone with a sense of curiosity and a desire for a deeper understanding of the world around them.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Choose our foundation year route if you want to strengthen your knowledge and skills before you progress to stage one of the BA (Hons) History degree</li>
<li>Explore the broad sweep of British, European and global history from the Renaissance to the twentieth century</li>
<li>Undertake fieldwork at historical locations ranging from country houses to industrial cities</li>
<li>Share your passion for the past by organising and marketing a high-profile public history conference</li>
<li>Benefit from the support of a dedicated and enthusiastic teaching team who are published experts in their field</li>
<li>Develop an impressive set of critical, theoretical and transferable skills which will give you a real advantage in securing a graduate career.</li>
</ul>
<p>History has the power to make us question who we are, how we have come to act the way we do, and the experiences that have shaped people’s lives in the past. Studying History will turn you into a critical thinker, ready to challenge received wisdoms.</p>
<p>This course provides you with a firm grounding in the skills and knowledge you need and introduces you to the subject of history, enabling you to achieve your full honours degree in four years.</p>
<h3>A deep sense of perspective</h3>
<p>With particular emphasis on modern and contemporary history, this course is academically rigorous, intellectually stimulating and politically relevant.  As well as covering broad historical themes, you will explore a wide range of specific topics - everything from the Enlightenment, Totalitarianism, the history of the body, and the British Country House.</p>
<p>You will also explore the history of non-European societies, with modules spanning the history of China, India, the Cold War and the impact of European imperial rule.</p>
<h3>Explore history outside the classroom</h3>
<p>We offer study visits and fieldtrips to bring your learning to life. You will explore the practical and intellectual applications of history in museums, art galleries, country houses, parks and heritage sites.</p>
<p>Recent visits have taken us to the Imperial War Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the city of Chester and the urban heartland of Manchester. And, of course, Derbyshire is the ideal location to study history - with its rich industrial past and thriving heritage industry, including a UNESCO World Heritage site.</p>
<h3>Study in America</h3>
<p>You can spend part of your second stage in America, experiencing a different academic culture and deepening your global perspectives. You will study at one of our partner universities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Indiana University - Purdue University Indianapolis</li>
<li>Eastern Michigan University</li>
<li>Keene State College, New Hampshire</li>
<li>Longwood University, Virginia</li>
</ul>
<h3>Real world learning</h3>
<p>You will use your research and creative skills to interpret the past for the benefit of the wider community. We provide exciting opportunities for projects involving international arts and heritage organisations. Among recent initiatives, our students have worked with Derbyshire County Record Office to encourage young people to take a greater interest in archives and with Derby Theatre, National Brewery Centre and Derby Museum.</p>
<p>You will also inspire others by organising and marketing a public conference and presenting your research to a wider audience. Topics explored at this conference have included the experience of British prisoners-of-war during the First World War, the fight against the Apartheid regime in South Africa, and the pleasure gardens of eighteenth-century London.</p>

<a id=""d.en.14260""></a>
    
    <h3>Skills for success</h3>
<p>At Derby you will gain attributes beyond those traditionally associated with History graduates. You will not only build your academic capabilities but also apply your historical knowledge to the workplace. We encourage you to develop skills in areas such as presentation and teamworking, which will help you stand out in the job market.</p>
<p>You can approach your future career with confidence: latest Unistats figures show that 95% of our students were in work or further study six months after completing their course.</p>
<h3>Wide-ranging career opportunities</h3>
<p>With a History degree you can follow a wide range of careers in the education profession, libraries, museums, archives, law, the civil service, management, marketing and the uniformed services. Recent graduates have, for instance, taken up professional roles in local authorities; in marketing for major national businesses; and in project consultancy advising global companies.</p>
<p>A growing number of our graduates also use their degree as a platform for rewarding postgraduate study in subjects such as History, Museum Studies, Archive Management and International Relations.</p>
<h3>Ensuring you’re ‘work-ready’</h3>
<p>Our <a href=""/study/employability/"">Careers and Employment Service</a> will provide you with support from day one of your course to ensure you leave Derby as a ‘work-ready’ graduate - industry aware, motivated and enterprising. Throughout your studies, you will also benefit from our Personal Development Planning (PDP) scheme which enables you to reflect on your learning and develop your career ambitions.

    <p><strong>In 1821 Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote that ‘poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world’. A century on, Ezra Pound described artists as the ‘antennae of the race’.

At the University of Derby, we believe that the study of literature should do this too.</strong></p>

    <p>During this course we apply the fact that electricity can be used to transport and deliver energy. It lights our homes, runs many of our domestic gadgets and keeps the wheels of industry turning. It is such an established and reliable part of our lives that we often take it for granted, yet it remains a fascinating and developing field of study.<br><br>Electrical engineering deals with the study of motors and generators and their control, power transmission and distribution systems and the principles that underlie them. In electronic engineering we apply electricity to carry, process and store information. This is the driving force behind today's information revolution, and forms the basis of everyday devices like the mobile phone and the computer, as well as a huge range of systems used in commerce and industry. You'll discover how electronics depends heavily on semiconductor technology, and that while electrical and electronic engineering depend on the same fundamental scientific laws, they diverge widely beyond these basics.<br><br>We've developed this part time course for students who are already working in a relevant area. The exciting thing about the course is that your employer becomes a partner in your education and you continue to study in your workplace. You'll take some work based learning modules, which will be tailored to the needs of you and your workplace.<br><br>At University you'll learn in a challenging, stimulating and creative environment. You'll also benefit from working closely with students on other related courses, covering areas including multimedia, music, and live event technology.</p>
<ul>
<li>You'll be trained in the technologies of electrical and electronic systems, preparing you for cutting edge work.</li>
<li>You'll get a broad introduction to the practical and theoretical aspects of the subject.</li>
<li>It's more than just engineering - you'll develop skills in management and communication too.</li>
<li>You'll study part time and so can fit it around your work.</li>

    <p>You can choose from two pathways; BSc (Hons) Computer Science (Software Development) or BSc (Hons) Computer Science (Networks and Security) pathway.</p>
<p>Our Computer Science degree with a Software Development pathway or a Networks and Security pathway is highly technical with a strong focus on the most important skills within the subject areas. Our Software Development pathway focuses on computer programming, with an emphasis on practical techniques underpinned by theory and informed by research. The Networks and Security pathway is based on a recognised industrial certification in Networks. There is a common first year with specialist modules in your second and final year – this approach gives you the time to understand which area you’re interested in most to help you decide which pathway to choose at the end of your first year.</p>
<p>In Computer Science (Software Development) you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Harness cutting-edge software development tools in our industry-standard laboratories</li>
<li>Learn from experienced computer scientists who have strong industry links</li>
</ul>
<p>In Computer Science (Networks and Security) you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Study an industry-recognised CISCO Certified Network Associate syllabus</li>
<li>Learn from experienced computer network specialists and ex-industry professionals</li>
</ul>

<a id=""d.en.119441""></a>
    
    <p>Whichever pathway you choose, you'll find that your advanced skills in software development or networks and security are in high demand. </p>
<p>The majority of computing jobs require software development abilities and experience. So whether you want to be a software engineer, project manager, technical architect or chief technology officer, the Software Development pathway will help you get there.</p>
<p>If you graduate from the Networks and Security pathway, you will be suited to roles that involve developing, maintaining, securing and managing computer networks, as well as jobs that involve the engineering side of network protocol development and research. </p>
<p>However, this degree will equip you with wide-ranging skills, which could lead on to many different careers in the computing field and beyond. For instance, your numerical and analytical skills will be very strong, and you should also be good at teamwork and project management.</p>

    <h3>The highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li>Join one of the best business management degrees in the UK — we've been ranked in the Top 20 for two years running (Guardian University Guide 2021).</li>
<li>We're looking for students who want to 'do' business, as well as learn about business — is that you? From the get-go, you'll be thinking about how to apply what you're learning, through topical case studies, business simulations, real consultancy projects and work placements. </li>
<li>Once you've completed your Foundation Year, you'll then join the honours degree and spend the first year covering all aspects of business management to find out where your passions and talents lie.</li>
<li>From year two, you can continue on a general Business Management pathway or choose one of the following:
<ul>
<li>Business Management (Business Technology)</li>
<li>Business Management (Enterprise)</li>
<li>Business Management (Finance)</li>
<li>Business Management (Human Resource Management)</li>
<li>Business Management (Marketing)</li>
<li>Business Management (Supply Chain and Logistics)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All pathways are accredited by the <a href=""https://www.managers.org.uk/"">Chartered Management Institute</a>, which means you gain an extra professional qualification on top of your degree as well as professional mentoring and access to CMI member benefits.</li>
<li>Most of the specialist pathways are also approved by other professional bodies — <a href=""https://www.cim.co.uk/"">CIM</a>, <a href=""https://www.cimaglobal.com/"">CIMA</a> and <a href=""https://www.cipd.co.uk/"">CIPD</a> — giving you extra credibility and exemptions from future professional exams.</li>
</ul>
</section>",,"<section class=""text-block"" role=""region"" id=""text-block-114208"">
<a id=""d.en.114208""></a>
    
    <p>By the end of the course you will have sound business acumen and a wide range of practical skills. You’ll graduate with not only a degree in Business Management, but with an extra professional qualification (the CMI Diploma) and a host of real-world experience, so you’ll already have a head start in the careers market.</p>
<p>If you opted for a specialist pathway, you will have deeper knowledge in a particular field and if that pathway had extra accreditation, you'll also be able to complete some professional exams quicker.</p>
<p>Because this is such a broad degree, lots of different job roles will be open to you, in areas such as project management, analysis, consultancy, accountancy, operations, human resource management, marketing, sales, logistics and finance. Previous students have gone on to work for prominent employers — including Deloitte, PwC, Capita, the BBC, DHL, Barclays, Tata, Mott MacDonald and IBM — while others have set up their own businesses. </p>
<p>Our <a href=""http://www.derby.ac.uk/study/careers/"">Careers and Employment Service</a> will provide you with support from day one of your course to ensure you leave Derby as a ‘work-ready’ graduate – industry aware, motivated and enterprising. Throughout your studies, you’ll also benefit from our Personal Development Planning (PDP) scheme which enables you to reflect on your learning and develop your career ambitions. </p>
<p>The support continues once you’ve completed your course too: you are entitled to further help and guidance from the Careers and Employment Service for up to three years after leaving our University.</p>
<h3>Further study</h3>
<p>You could continue your studies with one of our masters programmes, including the <a href=""https://www.derby.ac.uk/postgraduate/business-courses/mba/"">MBA Global and MBA Global Finance</a> or <a href=""https://www.derby.ac.uk/postgraduate/business-courses/international-business-msc/"">MSc International Business</a>.</p>

    <h3>The highlights</h3>
<ul>
<li>The course focuses on developing your practical laboratory skills, so you'll gain first-hand experience of lab work from year one</li>
<li>You'll also spend time honing your interpersonal skills and general employability, so you can move on to a diverse range of careers in clinical and public health laboratories, industry and research settings</li>
<li>We are currently seeking accreditation for this course from the <a href=""https://www.ibms.org/home/"">Institute of Biomedical Science</a>. Upon successful accreditation, the degree will fast-track your journey towards registration as a biomedical scientist with the Health and Care Professions Council</li>
<li>All of our teaching team are active researchers as well as teachers, so they will be able to share some of the latest findings and innovative thinking from the human health field</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a progressive, challenging course which focuses on the latest advances in medical research aimed at preventing ill health and prolonging life. The devastating COVID-19 pandemic has increased demand for skills in this area, so this degree is highly relevant right now and you can expect to have strong career prospects.</p>
<p>Biomedical Science is a broad discipline of modern medical science. It is all about understanding human health and the diseases that affect the normal processes in the human body, including their diagnosis. On this degree you'll gain the skills and knowledge to understand the operation of human organisms through subjects like clinical chemistry, immunology, microbiology, histology, clinical genetics, molecular biology, pathology and cancer biology.</p>
<h3>Training you for research</h3>
<p>During the programme, you will gain an understanding of biomedical investigations, diagnosis, monitoring and disease treatment. There's a strong focus on laboratory research and you will gain first-hand experience of this from year one. You will have access to a student research laboratory and regularly get the chance to conduct scientific investigations — sometimes in a group and sometimes on your own. You will also need to report your findings to others, including at a student conference attended by employers.</p>
<p>As well as giving you this practical experience, we will of course teach you the essential underpinning knowledge around research governance, ethics, and good scientific practice. In your final year, you will have the opportunity to demonstrate the research skills you have amassed, with an independent study into an area of your choice. This will be a lab-based study or one that uses clinical data.</p>

<h3>Beginning with a foundation year</h3>
<p>Starting at foundation level is ideal if it has been a while since you were in formal education; are planning a career change; would benefit from a more gradual introduction to university level study; or do not meet the entry requirements to join our three-year honours degree directly.</p>
