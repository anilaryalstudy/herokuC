Our part-time, distance-based course gives you the opportunity to learn in the workplace and get qualified with an MSc APP in Paediatric Musculoskeletal Health. Cover topics on the neonate, the infant, as well as growth, development and nutrition where you can address issues such as risk factors and public health, including breastfeeding, supine sleep in infancy, physical activity in children and conditions affecting the musculoskeletal health of children from birth.,There have been some recent changes to the MSc Advanced Professional Practice course framework, which mean the Musculoskeletal Health of the Neonate, Musculoskeletal Health of the Infant and Toddler and Growth, Development and Nutrition units will now be delivered online.,You will direct your own learning through online materials and reflective practice. Learn to integrate the latest evidence to inform your clinical decisions and help you in providing best care to your paediatric patients. You will be assessed through critical reviews, reflective accounts, and in the last year through a research dissertation or audit. ,We understand how busy lives can be, so we have kept necessary attendance at AECC University College campus to a minimum. Online materials and activities are designed to support the students in the completion of the units.

Perhaps you want to work in a different area of the medical profession? Well, have you considered the rewarding and challenging field of Medical Ultrasound? It’s rapidly become an essential part of investigative healthcare and is used to support a variety of medical professionals including radiographers, physiotherapists, chiropractors, podiatrists, nurses, midwives, and doctors.,Developed by our ,, the MSc Medical Ultrasound course supports your professional development. Accredited by CASE for six years from February 2018, the course will give you the specialist knowledge, plus all the advanced clinical and practical skills needed for ultrasound practice. In your first and second years of the postgraduate degree, you’ll get the chance to select the units that are right for you, choosing between a series of clinical application and non-skills based units to build up your range of abilities.,What’s more, as we know not everyone is available to study on a full-time basis, we’ve made the course part-time so you gain your qualification while you work. The degree is made up of three progressive levels - the Postgraduate Certificate, the Postgraduate Diploma and the Masters - meaning that if you want to finish early you can get an exit qualification at the end of each stage, allowing you to tailor a learning experience that’s right for you.,With our expertise you will develop an understanding of the science and instrumentation of ultrasound in order to produce optimum images, with safety and quality assurance to make sure you lead with best practice. Choose from optional units in Gynaecology, First Trimester, Second and Third Trimester, General and Musculoskeletal Ultrasound to get the most out of your course to suit your needs.,You’ll be taught by actively practising practitioners and highly-qualified academic staff, who will guide you on your educational journey through professional development, experiential learning and reflective practice, tutorials, workshops, practical clinical skills classes, seminars, small group work, and lectures. Private study will form a significant part of your learning; reading and researching and preparing presentations and assignments, spending roughly an average of 8 hours per week study time.","<div class=""col-md-6"">
