<p>Sport has a unique, high profile position globally, and is significantly important because of its wide-ranging financial, health and social benefits. However, there is a risk that these impacts will not be realised because we are in the middle of an era when sport is being undermined by a range of internal and external corruptive forces, such as doping, gambling, and an increasing number of welfare issues. Robust research is needed to help grow trustworthiness and protect the sport system from fraud, misconduct and non-compliance.</p>
<p>The Sport Forensics research programme, developed and delivered by Abertay University with KPMG, is the first in the world focused on supporting sporting organisations in achieving the highest levels of integrity. The programme uniquely applies a forensic approach to examine where behaviour doesn’t comply with expectations or regulations in sport. Research projects focus on hidden factors that may be impacting negatively within sports organisations.</p>

<p>Abertay’s Sport and Exercise Sciences Division has expertise in women’s sport equity; sedentary lifestyle risk factors; exercise and health training interventions; high-intensity exercise; elite sports performance; and healthy ageing. Much of this research focuses on work involving populations with protected characteristics (e.g. age, gender, disability) and aims to contribute to the duty of care agenda, which has growing salience as an issue in contemporary sport. This complements our work with Police Scotland, Active Schools, national governing bodies, charities and SMEs.</p>
<p>The Division has two designated human performance laboratories for physiological measurement, a strength and conditioning laboratory, and a biomechanics laboratory to support teaching and research. These facilities allow access to EMG and ECG equipment; ergometers; biofeedback systems; accelerometry; force transducers; electronic timing systems; gas and blood analysis equipment; GSR equipment and software; BioHarness Telemetry System; Vicon 3D motion analysis system; force platform; jump mats; segmental bio-impedance; body composition analysis; and linear position transducers.</p>
<p>Interdisciplinary work with other divisions enables access to more specialist biochemical and molecular physiology equipment, as well as opportunities to explore realistic human movement with our games design colleague’s.</p>
<p>Abertay researchers have established performance partnerships with the Scottish Rugby Union, Dundee United Football Club, Dundee Football Club, Fife Flyers Ice Hockey team, and this work is generating a number of new and exciting research opportunities.</p>

<p>The economics of providing high-quality accommodation has become a global issue in the 21st Century. Owner-occupation is declining and governments around the world are withdrawing from the housing sector as private sector involvement continues to grow. In the UK, Labour/Conservative governments alike have addressed the need for institutional investment with measures/structures aimed at encouraging investment within real estate. However, institutional investment remains comparatively low, with buy-to-let being a fractured/cottage industry. Real Estate Investment Trust is a specialist area within Abertay, with academic staff having considerable professional experience within the asset management industry. Industry links are vital for relevant research within the sector, and Abertay is fortunate to employ staff who are active members of both the Society of Property Forecasters and are CFA charter holders.</p>

<p>The Abertay Oil and Gas Accounting and Finance (OGAF) group consists of an interdisciplinary group of academics and practitioners with extensive academic and practical experience of all business, management and commercial aspects of oil, gas and energy. The group has a particular focus on developing an ongoing dialogue with industry practitioners and organisations through a focussed programme of research, consultancy and continuing professional development programmes. The group is led by Professor Reza Kouhy who holds a Chair of Energy and Environmental Accounting.</p>
<p>Abertay has a very strong history of research projects, PhD supervision and publications in high-quality journals on such issues as corporate disclosures on environmental issues; abandonment problems associated with oil and gas companies operating in the North Sea and Nigeria and the implications for UK governmental policy; gas flaring and oil spillage, legitimacy and environmental disclosures. These projects have shown that some corporations disclose environmental information (including oil and gas related information) so as to either legitimise their activities or to report a more favourable set of accounts. The group intends to build on this work, through PhD supervisions by studying the link between environmental disclosures and corporate performance; environmental responsibilities and governmental control; legitimacy and regulation; internationalisation of standards and corporate accountability, and oil and gas reserves valuation.</p>

<p>Data Science &amp; Informatics at Abertay University covers a wide range of applied and theoretical research. Our research looks at fields including Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, through to Data and Information Visualisation.</p>
<p>Data Science has found applications across industry sectors, with business seeking to generate value from data using artificial intelligence and machine learning. The full economic and societal benefits have yet to be reaped. These benefits are enormous, particularly when combined with other emergent technologies such as AR/VR for data driven design and production processes in key industries. Embedding AI across the UK will create thousands of high-quality jobs and drive economic growth.</p>
<p>A recent study found digital technologies including AI created a net total of 80,000 new jobs annually across a population similar to the UK. It is estimated that AI could add £232bn to the UK economy by 2030 (UK Government Industrial Strategy White Paper 2017).</p>
<p>Our application areas of Data Science are aligned with our key strengths in Games and Cyber Security. We are exploring how AI and neural networks can generate content for games, and how data analytics can improve the player experience.</p>
<p>We are also applying state of the art Machine Learning models for intrusion detection systems. Our expertise is broadening its reach into areas including health, community and social care. The majority of our research projects are rooted in client-facing, real-world problems faced by games companies, charities, innovation centres and more.</p>
<p>Our vibrant research culture encourages areas of cross- and inter-disciplinary working. An example of this is a collaboration between psychology and data science where data analytics are applied to understand how people learn through game-based learning.</p>

                    <h2>Why Study Ethical Hacking and Cyber Security?</h2>
                    <p>Provisionally certified by the National Cyber Security Centre - part of GCHQ - this Masters degree develops the skills and mind set needed to tackle the growing threat of computer hackers. Computer security is a growing concern for organisations of all sizes. This Masters will put you in the ideal position to pursue a successful and often lucrative career. It’s not unusual for the salaries of graduates from this programme to start at £35,000-£40,000. The industry is currently experiencing a major skills gap and global demand for ethical hackers.  </p>
<p>We’re the only university in the UK to offer a Masters programme in ethical hacking. We want to change the way you view cyber security to adopt an offensive approach. The best way to beat a hacker is to be able to think like one!  </p>
<p>Aimed at Computing/IT graduates, our MSc Ethical Hacking and Cyber Security covers a wide range of subjects, including penetration testing, digital forensics, information security management, Malware analysis, port scanning, buffer overflows and password cracking. Our research-active teaching staff are at the forefront of new developments, allowing the programme to evolve to cover the latest techniques and guidelines.</p>
<p>There are two modes of studying this degree. Full-time, on-campus over one year or, part-time  distance learning over two years.</p>
<p>In recent years, full-time on-campus class sizes have been around 10-15 people, and they’re unlikely to go higher than 20. This allows for closer relationships with academic staff and fellow postgraduates.</p>
<p>The part-time distance option offers a virtual lab for practical work and weekly sessions to meet staff, fellow students and get help.</p>
<p>Abertay graduates have gone on to work for organisations such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dell Secure Works</li>
<li>Goldman-Sachs</li>
<li>NCR</li>
<li>GCHQ</li>
