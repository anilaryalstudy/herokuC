	<h2>Course content</h2>
    <p>The four-year MSci Marine Biology programme mirrors the <a href=""/undergraduate/courses/biosciences/marinebio/"">BSc Marine Biology</a> programme during the first three years, and includes an additional fourth year during which you will undertake an advanced research project. You will also undertake a two-week intensive field course in which your scientific field-research, debating, and presentation skills will be further developed.</p>
<p>The programme provides you with the skills, concepts and experience to understand all aspects of marine ecosystems and the pressures they face, ranging from overexploitation to climate change. Our interdisciplinary approach to the study of marine ecosystems, from rocky shores to open-oceans and from shallow surface seas to deep-water habitats, allows you to learn about a wide range of theoretical and practical techniques. This interface between research and learning provides critical skills for career opportunities across a wide range of scientific disciplines.</p>
    
    	<p><i>The modules we outline here provide examples of what you can expect to learn on this degree course based on recent academic teaching. The precise modules available to you in future years may vary depending on staff availability and research interests, new topics of study, timetabling and student demand.</i></p>

<p class=""Paragraph SCXW162760114 BCX0"">The four-year MSci Zoology programme mirrors the <a href=""/undergraduate/courses/biosciences/zoology/"">BSc Zoology</a> programme during the first three years, and includes an additional fourth year during which you will undertake a research project, an advanced statistical modelling module and a literature review. The research project will focus on a specialised area aligned with one of our leading research groups. The remainder of your time will be spent on a two-week intensive field course in which your scientific field-research, debating, and presentation skills will be further developed.</p>
<p>The programme focuses on an understanding of the biology of animals, with an emphasis on whole animal biology, biodiversity, ecology and behaviour, along with the evolution of the whole spectrum of animal life histories.</p>
<p>This programme will provide you with the skills, concepts and experience to understand all aspects of modern zoology. The programme encourages an interdisciplinary approach and you will be exposed to a wide range of theoretical and practical techniques used to study the biology of animals of all types.</p>

    <p>Our BSc Marine Biology programme focuses on understanding the biology of marine organisms and their ecosystems. We place special emphasis on whole animal biology, biodiversity, ecology and behaviour.</p>
<p>The programme provides you with the skills, concepts and experience to understand all aspects of marine ecosystems and the pressures they face, ranging from overexploitation to climate change. Our interdisciplinary approach to the study of marine ecosystems, from rocky shores to open-oceans and from shallow surface seas to deep-water habitats, allows you to learn about a wide range of theoretical and practical techniques. This interface between research and learning provides critical skills for career opportunities across a wide range of scientific disciplines.</p>
    
    	<p><i>The modules we outline here provide examples of what you can expect to learn on this degree course based on recent academic teaching. The precise modules available to you in future years may vary depending on staff availability and research interests, new topics of study, timetabling and student demand.</i></p>

	<h2>Course content</h2>
    <p>The study of human behaviour, culture and society is often set apart from the natural world. Yet humans, like other animals, have an evolutionary history and evolutionary forces continue to shape the way we live today. Important insights can therefore come from studying humans in the same way as we study other animals. Many of the problems we currently face, such as the biodiversity crisis, climate change, or the conflicts which occur within or between countries, relate to how humans create, shape and interact with their natural and social environments. Solutions to these problems will come from insights generated from a number of different disciplines.</p>
<p>Bridging the gap between the natural and social sciences, our Human Sciences programme allows you to combine exciting disciplines to make connections between biological processes, social patterns and political and environmental issues. It will enable you to understand relationships between science and policy and show how you may be able to facilitate decision-making in this context.</p>

              <p>You will develop both knowledge and practical skills in a range of core disciplines in the human sciences. This year includes lectures and laboratory work, introducing you to modern approaches to understanding the biology of organisms including humans, through ecology, genetics and evolution, to the comparative study of social and cultural patterns of world populations. You will also develop important communication and analytical skills.</p>

              <p>In your second year, you will perform a more in-depth examination of the subject areas to which you were introduced in your first year. For example, you will consider the evolutionary origins of human behaviour by exploring the relationship between human cultural processes and human genetic processes. In particular, you will be encouraged to investigate the ways in which human beings both shape their environments and are shaped by them. You may also undertake a residential field course on the Isles of Scilly*.</p>

The research project will focus on a specialised area aligned with one of our leading research groups. The remainder of your time will be spent on a two-week intensive field course in which your scientific field-research, debating, and presentation skills will be further developed.</p>
<p>Evolutionary Biology is a fast growing area of study, utilising ever-more sophisticated technology to unravel the history of life on earth. During our MSci Evolutionary Biology you will utilise our cutting-edge facilities to develop advanced knowledge in this rapidly developing field, which encompasses genetics, animal behaviour, and psychology, and examine evolution from many perspectives – from the smallest building blocks of life to entire ecosystems.</p>

    <p>On our BSc Evolutionary Biology you will utilise our cutting-edge facilities to develop advanced knowledge in this rapidly developing field, which encompasses genetics, animal behaviour and psychology, and examine evolution from many perspectives – from the smallest building blocks of life to entire ecosystems.</p>
<p>As a fast growing area of study, it is led by some of the UK’s foremost internationally-recognised, research active staff in the <a href=""http://biosciences.exeter.ac.uk/cec/aboutus/"">Centre for Ecology and Conservation</a> on our Penryn Campus in Cornwall. The Centre hosts a large and thriving group of scientists who work at the cutting edge of research on evolutionarily informed organismal biology and run research projects across the globe, from Uganda to Australia. The programme utilises expertise in the Centre to provide you with the skills, concepts and experience to understand all aspects of modern evolutionary biology.</p>

	<h2>Course content</h2>
    <p>It is well known that the first two decades of life represent an important window of opportunity to not only improve the health and well-being of young people, but also their health status into adult life. The role that physical activity and fitness can play in improving markers of health and well-being in young people is an important area of study, especially given concerns of declining fitness and increasing obesity in today’s children and adolescents.</p>
<p>Based on the internationally-recognised research conducted in the <a href=""http://sshs.exeter.ac.uk/research/childrenshealth/"">Children’s Health and Exercise Research Centre</a> (CHERC), our Masters programme in Paediatric Exercise and Health offers a thorough grounding in the unique physiological responses of children and adolescents during exercise and how these responses are influenced by age, sex and biological maturation. It provides an in-depth evaluation of the relationships between physical activity, fitness and health in young people.</p>
<p>You will gain experience of both theoretical and hands-on methods used to evaluate physical activity and fitness, plus advanced training in research methods and analytical procedures.</p>

	<h2>Course content</h2>
    <p>This degree captures the distinctive approach to sociology and anthropology at the University of Exeter, taking an interdisciplinary perspective on the some of the biggest issues and questions facing contemporary societies and, more specifically, those concerning science and technology.</p>
<p>You will examine science and technology and their relationship with the social and cultural context of their production.</p>
<p>Our programmes have been planned, organised and are delivered in a way oriented towards tapping into and addressing points of overlap and divergence between different disciplinary perspectives. These perspectives are explored, explained and made relevant to the material covered.</p>
<p>The core module in social theory is concerned in the broadest sense with the distinctiveness, or not, of human life and experience in late modern society. More specifically, social theory can be understood as a series of intellectual formulations concerned to respond to a range of questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does the structure and organisation of society shape how individuals think and (inter-)act?</li>
<li>What does it mean to say that social order is achieved and how does this occur?</li>
<li>How and in what ways are our identities and actions enabled and constrained by social structures?</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll introduce you to a range of central themes and issues that both classical and contemporary social theorists have addressed in their work equipping you with a broad range of conceptual tools with which to understand and research the social world.</p>
<p>You’ll also chose from a range of optional modules covering fields such as research methods, gender at work, health and wellbeing, data visualisation and philosophy of science.</p>
    
    	<p><i>The modules we outline here provide examples of what you can expect to learn on this degree course based on recent academic teaching. The precise modules available to you in future years may vary depending on staff availability and research interests, new topics of study, timetabling and student demand.</i></p>

	<h2>Course content</h2>
    <p>Taking an interdisciplinary perspective on some of the biggest issues and questions related to the study of culture and society, this degree provides training in the analysis of a wide range of cultural forms, practices and media, reflecting critically on the modes by which they are produced, evaluated and consumed.</p>
<p>You will examine culture and society and their relationship with power, agency, human senses and aesthetics. </p>
<p>Our programmes have been planned, organised and are delivered in a way oriented towards tapping into and addressing points of overlap and divergence between different disciplinary perspectives. These perspectives are explored, explained and made relevant to the material covered.</p>
<p>The core module in social theory is concerned in the broadest sense with the distinctiveness, or not, of human life and experience in late modern society. More specifically, social theory can be understood as a series of intellectual formulations concerned to respond to a range of questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does the structure and organisation of society shape how individuals think and (inter-)act?</li>
<li>What does it mean to say that social order is achieved and how does this occur?</li>
<li>How and in what ways are our identities and actions enabled and constrained by social structures?</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll introduce you to a range of central themes and issues that both classical and contemporary social theorists have addressed in their work equipping you with a broad range of conceptual tools with which to understand and research the social world.</p>
<p>You’ll also chose from a range of optional modules covering fields such as research methods, gender at work, health and wellbeing, data visualisation and philosophy of science.</p>
    
    	<p><i>The modules we outline here provide examples of what you can expect to learn on this degree course based on recent academic teaching. The precise modules available to you in future years may vary depending on staff availability and research interests, new topics of study, timetabling and student demand.</i></p>

    <p>This distinctive MRes aims to develop a systematic understanding and critical appreciation of alternative approaches, methodologies and paradigms of social science research. It will develop fully trained and competent social science researchers, who are able to understand and use research techniques appropriate to their subject area as well as being conversant with approaches used by other social scientists.</p>
<p>The programme has a substantial theoretical and quantitative core but also delivers complementary qualitative training. This will provide an essential foundation for any working researcher, whether they are going on to do a PhD or otherwise engaged in research. The training will enable students to think through how they can use their knowledge and skills of advanced quantitative methods in different contexts and apply them to a variety of problems; and, progressively, to identify their own needs for training.</p>

    <p>The MRes in Politics is a training programme designed to equip you with the research skills necessary to progress to a doctoral research degree, or to embark upon on a career as a political researcher. It provides generic research methods training in social science, as well as more specific research training in politics (including any chosen political specialism) and international relations.</p>
<p>This programme has ‘1+3’ recognition from the UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), which means it can be taken as the first step of a <a href=""/pg-research/degrees/politics/"">four-year PhD programme</a>. You may therefore take the MRes on its own as a stand-alone qualification, or as the first year of our Four Year PhD Programme, in which case your dissertation will be used as a platform for your PhD level research.</p>
<p>This programme also forms part of the ESRC SWDTP – a hub of world-class social sciences research.</p>

	<h2>Course content</h2>
    <p>Ethics and society is a fascinating and extremely relevant field of philosophy to study. We are constantly confronted with new developments in society that, as individuals and communities, we must decide how to respond to, if at all.</p>
<p>Our core module <em>Contemporary Ethics</em> will address these challenges by introducing you to the philosophical work of the past three decades, addressing current challenges related to human self-understanding and ethical theory.</p>
<p>Our focus on philosophical research methods will teach you how to reflect critically on a range of methods and explore their respective strengths and weakness. You’ll discover a range of different tools for approaching philosophical questions, providing an excellent grounding for further research in philosophy.</p>
<p>You will be taught by staff who are research active in the field and who bring this research directly into their teaching. Our small group seminars enable you to interact closely with academics and also peers, providing a safe and stimulating environment in which to develop and debate your own ideas and opinions, discuss readings and learn from others.</p>
<p>Due to our interdisciplinary approach you will have the benefit of a wide choice of optional modules from across sociology and anthropology as well as philosophy. You can choose to explore fields such as social theory and cultural sociology.</p>
<p>You will undertake modules to the value of 180 credits comprised of a combination of compulsory and optional modules.</p>
    
    	<p><i>The modules we outline here provide examples of what you can expect to learn on this degree course based on recent academic teaching. The precise modules available to you in future years may vary depending on staff availability and research interests, new topics of study, timetabling and student demand.</i></p>

	<h2>Course content</h2>
    <p>This is a blended learning course that combines online study with residential teaching.</p>
<h3>Residentials</h3>
<p>There are three residential courses in Years 1 and 2, respectively, typically 7-10 working days in duration. The first residential is normally held in Cornwall while the second and third are held in international mining locations (in the past we have visited Alaska, Canada, Australia, Chile, South Africa). Residential dates are available at the start of the course and residential courses typically take place in March, July and November. There are two residential courses in Year 3 and both are held in Cornwall.</p>
<p>Residential attendance is a compulsory component of the programme.</p>
<p>For 2021 the provisional residential dates and locations are as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>Residential 1 will normally be held in Cornwall in March (8-19 March 2021 are the provisional dates)</li>
<li>Residential 2 will normally be held in Australia or Canada in July (12-23 July 2021 are the provisional dates)</li>
<li>Residential 3 will normally be held in South Africa or Chile in November (8-19 November 2020 are the provisional dates) </li>
</ul>
<p>The above dates and locations are provisional and will be confirmed nearer the time.</p>
<h3>Course structure</h3>
<p>Year one provides a robust understanding of the complete mining life cycle, from exploration and development to extraction and processing methods to waste management and mine closure. Year one of the course is also an excellent programme for new entrants into the mining business as a fast-track career induction.</p>

              <p>This module will provide you with extensive practical work that is of direct relevance to your development as an experienced professional. You will get the chance to apply the knowledge and skills you have acquired from taught modules to authentic problem solving in the work place. Collaborating with your work placement employer, you will identify a project that will constitute your MSc dissertation. Ideally, the dissertation should be based on the work that you will undertake during the placement, but this is not compulsory.</p>
<h4>MSc Dissertation</h4>
<p>This dissertation will give you the chance to demonstrate your knowledge, to exercise your initiative and personal responsibility, and to use the research techniques and skills you have developed throughout your degree.</p>
<p>You will be required to solve a research or industrially-related practical problem based on the topics learned within, but not exclusive to, the MSc programme you are registered for. The project work will lead to a major piece of work (dissertation) of approximately 15,000 words (max. 80 pages, including references and appendices) that involves project planning, analytical, experimental or empirical results and their interpretation, showing how the goals of the project have been met. You will receive a list of potential projects and will be required to express your two preferences. Alternatively, you can discuss your own dissertation ideas with the module leader / potential supervisor (academic staff) with a view to explore if they offer required technical rigour and research challenge. You will be encouraged to discuss your preferences with relevant academic staff before we allocate projects. As part of the research project, you are expected to undertake a considerable amount of self-study. There is no formal taught component in the module, apart from suggested regular meetings with the supervisor.</p>
<p>Prerequisite modules: All compulsory modules listed for (or equivalent) the MSc programme you are registered for.</p>

	<h2>Course content</h2>
    <p>Studying a Master of Laws in International Law offers a rewarding learning experience with opportunities to deepen your understanding of international law, and to improve skills necessary at all levels of professional engagement with contemporary and future challenges of international law.</p>
<p>The Exeter LLM is a substantive, rigorous, and flexible programme of postgraduate study designed for the most ambitious and capable students. You will be actively encouraged to engage in discussion and debates with your peers and academic staff. </p>
<p>Alongside the compulsory dissertation, you’ll choose from an array of optional modules such as Human Dignity and Human Rights in the EU, International Criminal Law and International Law of Armed Conflict. </p>
<p>In order to enhance students’ research and learning experiences and to create a vibrant community of postgraduate students enrolled in this programme, students will be affiliated with one of the research centres for the duration of their programme.</p>
<p>If you start the LLM in January, you will complete your dissertation before finishing all the taught elements of the programme. The LLM allows you to take the dissertation without requiring a focus from other modules on the course as there is no prerequisite to the dissertation module. You will choose your dissertation topic during the first term (so we can allocate you an appropriate supervisor) and you will then submit your dissertation before the official deadline in August (date will be confirmed by the Law School).</p>

    <p>Studying an LLM Master of Laws offers unrivalled academic stimulation, the opportunity to deepen your understanding of the law, and improved career prospects at the highest level whether that be in practice or academia.</p>
<p>The Exeter LLM is a substantive, rigorous, and flexible programme of postgraduate study designed for the most ambitious and capable students. You will be actively encouraged to engage in discussion and debates with your peers and academic staff.</p>
<p>Alongside the compulsory dissertation, you’ll choose from an array of optional modules such as Competition Law and Law of the Sea to Environmental and Energy Law or Artificial Intelligence and the Law.</p>
<p>In addition to your studies, you’ll have the opportunity to benefit from a stimulating programme of research seminars designed to enable staff and postgraduate students to experience cutting edge research by members of the academic and legal community both within and outside of Exeter.</p>

<p>The programme is divided into units of study called modules which are assigned a number of 'credits'. The credit rating of a module is proportional to the total workload, with 1 credit being nominally equivalent to 10 hours of work.</p>
<p>See the <a href=""/media/universityofexeter/postgraduatewebsite/docs/MPH_Programme_Schematic.pdf"">MPH programme schematic</a> to see the programme structure.</p>
<h3>Modules</h3>
<p>The modules we outline here provide examples of what you can expect to learn on this degree course based on recent academic teaching. The precise modules available to you in future years may vary depending on staff availability and research interests, new topics of study, timetabling and student demand.</p>
<p>The MPH comprises 180 credits in total: taught compulsory modules worth 135 credits in total, one optional module (Masterclass) of 15 credits, and a Capstone Project worth 30 credits.<br><br>It is also possible to exit with a PGCert after completing 60 credits of taught modules or a PGDip after completing 120 credits of taught modules. The list of modules below shows which are compulsory.</p>
<p>Modules will use a blend of synchronous and asynchronous learning throughout 2020/2021.  Generally, synchronous content will be delivered face-to-face, with live remote participation available if needed.  However, synchronous content may be delivered fully online if necessary.<br><br><a href=""/media/universityofexeter/recruitmentsites/docs/MPH_timetable_20_21v0909.pdf"">View the draft timetable of contact days for 2020/21</a> (please note: these dates are subject to change)</p>

    <p>With the increased awareness of global burdens such as humanitarian crises and sudden onset disasters, more than ever there is a need to be delivering healthcare in highly complex and demanding situations.</p>
<p>This unique programme is delivered in partnership between the University of Exeter Medical School and World Extreme Medicine, the world's leading provider of specialist training courses for medics taking their skills into challenging environments.</p>
<p>This is medicine at its best, crossing geographical and professional boundaries.</p>
<p>You will learn the practical skills, knowledge and understanding needed to perform at the highest possible level in the field of extreme medicine. You can also choose to undertake a specialism in Cold Environments, Hot Environments or Humanitarian Relief.</p>
<p>Who this programme is suitable for:</p>
<p>• Paramedics<br>• Medics<br>• Nurses<br>• Medical scientists<br>• Allied healthcare professionals<br>• Military medics<br>• Intercalating medical students </p>
<p>The Extreme Medicine course is a distance-learning programme, delivered through attendance at residentials in the UK or overseas. These are not University of Exeter-delivered field trips, but rather the in-person delivery of the course, provided by World Extreme Medicine, will take place at the relevant delivery site for the module. No teaching is delivered on the university campuses.</p>
<h3>Programme structure</h3>
<p>Throughout this programme you will critically examine the challenges of providing safe and effective healthcare in a range of challenging environments. Key to this learning to recognise and evaluate the unique ethical, professional and legal challenges of delivering medical care in these environments.</p>
<p>You will undertake a number of residential courses to help you develop these skills, as well as giving you the opportunity to learn with and from your peers.</p>
<p>Expert tutors will facilitate group discussions and project work and provide support for independent learning. Assessments are designed to provide opportunities for personal reflection, critical appraisal, evaluation and analysis to demonstrate the knowledge and skills gained throughout the programme.</p>
<h3>Specialisms</h3>
<p>You are able to specialise in particular areas of Extreme Medicine. This specialism will be reflected in your award title provided you have taken the appropriate modules specified below, and completed an independent research project in the relevant field.</p>
<p>Depending on the specific modules taken, students may receive one of the following named awards:</p>
<p>• MSc in Extreme Medicine (Cold Environment)<br>• MSc in Extreme Medicine (Hot Environment)<br>• MSc in Extreme Medicine (Humanitarian Relief)</p>
<p>Your eligibility for the particular award will be confirmed by the final Assessment Progression and Awarding Committee (APAC) on the basis of the modules that have been completed. In order to graduate with a particular named award in parentheses, you will need to notify the programme support team accordingly. Otherwise the award name will be MSc in Extreme Medicine.</p>
<h3>Modules and delivery</h3>
<p>The programme is also divided into units of study called ‘modules’ which are assigned a number of ‘credits’. The credit rating of a module is proportional to the total workload, with one credit being nominally equivalent to 10 hours of work.<br><br>To gain a Masters qualification (which equates to 180 credits at level 7), you will need to complete 120 credits of taught modules and a 60 credit dissertation.</p>
<p>It is also possible to exit with a PGCert after completing 60 credits of taught modules or a PGDip after completing 120 credits of taught modules. The list of modules below shows which are compulsory.</p>

It will not be necessary for students to be in Exeter, the majority of modules will be asynchronous, giving students the flexibility to study at their own pace at a time that is convenient for them. Students will be fully supported in their online learning with access to academic tutors throughout. Some optional on-campus tutorials will also be offered</strong></p>","<section id=""course-content"">   
	<h2>Course content</h2>
    <p>Practice in the clinical professions will be transformed by genomic technologies and information within the next decade.</p>
<p>This MSc programme has been developed by Health Education England and is aligned with their vision to prepare the NHS for the legacy of the <a href=""https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/about-genomics-england/the-100000-genomes-project/"">100,000 Genomes Project</a>.</p>
<p>This will be achieved through education and training that is focused on developing skilled graduates who can apply genomic medicine for patient benefit.</p>
<p>The programme is offered by a network of seven universities across England and includes study of the genomics and informatics of rare and common diseases, cancer and infectious diseases, which can be applied to clinical practice and medical research. The programme enhances knowledge and skills in this rapidly evolving field.</p>
<p>Students are likely to be clinical practitioners, diagnostic service providers, scientists, researchers and those aspiring to specialise within an academic career pathway.</p>
<h3>Awards</h3>
<p>The programme is also divided into units of study called ‘modules’ which are assigned a number of ‘credits’. The credit rating of a module is proportional to the total workload, with one credit being nominally equivalent to 10 hours of work.</p>
<p>To gain a Masters qualification (which equates to 180 credits at level 7), you will need to complete 120 credits of taught modules and a 60 credit dissertation.</p>
<p>It is also possible to exit with a PGCert after completing 60 credits of taught modules or a PGDip after completing 120 credits of taught modules. The list of modules below shows which are compulsory.</p>

	<h2>Course content</h2>
    <p>The four-year MSci Exercise and Sport Sciences programme mirrors the BSc Exercise and Sport Science programme during the first three years, but also includes an additional fourth year during which you will be able to intensively pursue research interests you have developed during your first three years.</p>
<p>This will culminate in the production of a research paper suitable for publication in academic journals, and attendance of a scientific conference. These opportunities are specifically designed to provide practical experience, promote confidence, and boost CV quality—all vital for improving your chances of employability after graduation.</p>
<p>The degree structure allows you to specialise in a particular area or to follow a broader-based programme. Modules are underpinned by the research excellence and applied expertise of our staff, allowing current cutting-edge material to be shared with you. Optional modules reflect the application of scientific knowledge in a variety of populations, such as athletes, children, and the general public.</p>
    
    	<p><i>The modules we outline here provide examples of what you can expect to learn on this degree course based on recent academic teaching. The precise modules available to you in future years may vary depending on staff availability and research interests, new topics of study, timetabling and student demand.</i></p>

    <p>The MEd TESOL has international recognition and is seen as an important professional qualification worldwide to enable TESOL teachers to enhance their career prospects. At Exeter, depending on the modules taken, completion of the MEd TESOL can help you to move into new areas within TESOL such as teacher education and training, English for special purposes, materials development and the teaching of English to young learners.</p>
<p>The programme will:</p>
<ul>
<li>develop and extend your understanding of key aspects of linguistics and learning theory and their influence on the teaching of English to speakers of other languages</li>
<li>enable you to make informed professional decisions regarding language teaching in the workplace and justify these to others</li>
<li>enable you to select, adapt and design materials and activities for language teaching</li>
<li>enable you to investigate and research aspects of TESOL in ways that will support continuing development and practice as a foreign language teaching professional</li>
</ul>
<h3>What is the difference between a Master of Education, a Postgraduate Diploma and a Postgraduate Certificate?</h3>
<p>To gain an MEd you must complete 180 credits of specified modules.</p>
<p>However, you may exit the programme early before completing 180 credits and still receive an award. These alternative awards are:</p>
<ul>
<li>If exiting the programme after completing 60 credits you will be awarded a Postgraduate Certificate (PGCert).</li>
<li>If exiting the programme after completing 120 credits you will be awarded a Postgraduate Diploma (PGDip).</li>

	<h2>Course content</h2>
    <p>Our MA in Special Educational Needs (SEN) enables students to develop an excellent understanding of special educational needs and disability 'policy practice and provision' in the UK. At the same time, students are given opportunities to consider key concepts pertaining to special educational needs and inclusive education in international and country specific contexts. Students can often focus on an area of choice, such as deaf education, dyslexia, inclusion. The dissertation in particular enables students to focus in-depth and research, usually through gathering and analysis of empirical data, an area of their own interest.</p>
<p>There is the option to choose a module which includes an experiential placement. This will allow you to gain hands-on experience in schools in England; this module strongly supports you in connecting theory and practice. We also host a number of visiting speakers, including people who work with children with SEN in schools or other educational settings.</p>
<p>You must take 180 credits in total to qualify with an MA qualification. This will either consist of taught modules to the value of 120 credits and a dissertation worth 60 credits, or a combination of modules, dissertation and <a href=""https://www.exeter.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/education/creditforpriorlearning/"">accredited prior learning or experience.</a></p>
<p>You are strongly encouraged to consider taking the Education Placement module (EFPM909) as your optional module, thereby gaining skills which can be helpful in finding employment following the course. <strong>Please note that this module has a limited number of places and these will be assigned on a first-come-first-served basis during module selection – early application for this programme is therefore advised for students interested in taking this module.

    <p>The overall purpose of this MSc is to prepare you for the independent conduct of educational research. You will acquire general social science research skills that can be used in different contexts and applied to a variety of problems, and also have the opportunity to specialise in a particular field of education within a research preparation framework.</p>
<p>As beginning educational researchers we will ensure that you understand the central and current ideas, concepts, debates, theories, philosophies and approaches employed in educational research. You will also develop a critical understanding of interpretive research, and competence in the planning and execution of such research.</p>
<p>Alongside developing your research skills you will also practise communicating research to an academic audience through a number of different media (oral and written). We aim to mirror the real world of educational research where we often work with others, be that other researchers, education professionals or our research participants.</p>
<p>As a full-time on campus student, you will take two sessions each week during term time. Part-time students take one session per week during term time.</p>
<p>If you are studying by distance learning, the online programme has set start and finish dates.</p>
<p>Each module consists of ten sessions delivered through a blended system of learning.</p>

	<h2>Course content</h2>
    <p>The MA in Language and Literacy Education is designed to develop your understanding of the theoretical foundations of teaching reading and writing, and the pedagogical implications of this.  It focuses principally on language and literacy education in the compulsory school phases, but would nonetheless have relevance to post-compulsory educators, and to educators engaged in language and literacy education in non-school settings.</p>
<p>The core modules of the programme address reading and writing, and engage you in critical enquiry in your school, or other settings, with an emphasis on improving the outcomes of learners in reading and writing.  At the same time, however, a distinctive feature of the programme is that each of the core modules also focuses on your own personal development, looking at children’s literature and reading for pleasure, and engaging you in undertaking your own creative writing.</p>
<p>You must take 180 credits in total to qualify with an MA qualification. This will either consist of taught modules to the value of 120 credits and a dissertation worth 60 credits, or a combination of modules, dissertation and <a href=""https://www.exeter.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/education/creditforpriorlearning/"">accredited prior learning or experience.</a></p>

    <p>This MA offers the opportunity to study the fascinating and constantly evolving field of education leadership and management. You will examine education leadership and management theory in relation to a range of local, national and international contexts and explore some of the major global trends in the field.</p>
<p>We believe our strengths are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A strong foundation in both educational leadership and management in ways that will connect strongly with the previous and future professional experiences of students</li>
<li>The specific establishment of educational leadership frameworks that students will be able to readily apply to professional contexts</li>
<li>A module that focuses on issues of educational leadership from a policy perspective (EFPM910: Education Policy)</li>
<li>An elective module covering a variety of areas (such as creative arts, SEN, etc.)</li>
<li>A relatively small number of modules enables students to have a less stressful and easier to manage learning experience</li>
<li>The possibility of placement</li>
</ul>
<p>You must take 180 credits in total to qualify with an MA qualification. This will either consist of taught modules to the value of 120 credits and a dissertation worth 60 credits, or a combination of modules, dissertation and <a href=""https://www.exeter.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/education/creditforpriorlearning/"">accredited prior learning or experience.</a></p>
<p>You are strongly encouraged to consider taking the Education Placement module (EFPM909) as your optional module, thereby gaining skills which can be helpful in finding employment following the course. <strong>Please note that this module has a limited number of places and these will be assigned on a first-come-first-served basis during module selection – early application for this programme is therefore advised for students interested in taking this module.

              <p>This module will provide you with extensive practical work that is of direct relevance to your development as an experienced professional. You will get the chance to apply the knowledge and skills you have acquired from taught modules to authentic problem solving in the work place. Collaborating with your work placement employer, you will identify a project that will constitute your MSc dissertation. Ideally, the dissertation should be based on the work that you will undertake during the placement, but this is not compulsory.</p>
<h3>MSc Project/Dissertation</h3>
<p>This dissertation will give you the chance to demonstrate your knowledge, to exercise your initiative and personal responsibility, and to use the research techniques and skills you have developed throughout your degree.</p>
<p>You will be required to solve a research or industrially-related practical problem based on the topics learned within, but not exclusive to, the MSc programme you are registered for. The project work will lead to a major piece of work (dissertation) of approximately 15,000 words (max. 80 pages, including references and appendices) that involves project planning, analytical, experimental or empirical results and their interpretation, showing how the goals of the project have been met. You will receive a list of potential projects and will be required to express your two preferences. Alternatively, you can discuss your own dissertation ideas with the module leader / potential supervisor (academic staff) with a view to explore if they offer required technical rigour and research challenge. You will be encouraged to discuss your preferences with relevant academic staff before we allocate projects. As part of the research project, you are expected to undertake a considerable amount of self-study. There is no formal taught component in the module, apart from suggested regular meetings with the supervisor.</p>
<p>Prerequisite modules: All compulsory modules listed for (or equivalent) the MSc programme you are registered for.</p>

	<h2>Course content</h2>
    <p>This exciting programme based in Truro, Cornwall is ideal for graduates who are planning or already undertaking a career within public health, health promotion, environmental health and protection, occupational health, workplace wellbeing or social enterprise.</p>
<p>Our students come from a variety of backgrounds and so the programme has been designed to enable you to enact meaningful change in any setting. You will learn how to assess the health profile of a population group anywhere in the world, particularly in the context of an ageing society and increased global urbanisation and derive solutions to address health inequalities.</p>
<p>The programme has been developed with reference to the training requirements of the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health and the UK Faculty of Public Health to maximise your future employability in the discipline of environment and human health sciences.</p>
<h3>Programme Structure</h3>
<p>The programme is also divided into units of study called ‘modules’ which are assigned a number of ‘credits’. The credit rating of a module is proportional to the total workload, with one credit being nominally equivalent to 10 hours of work.</p>
<p>To gain a Masters qualification (which equates to 180 credits at level 7), you will need to complete 120 credits of taught modules and a 60 credit dissertation.</p>
<p>It is also possible to exit with a PGCert after completing 60 credits of taught modules or a PGDip after completing 120 credits of taught modules. The list of modules below shows which are compulsory.</p>

	<h2>Course content</h2>
    <p>Sustainability research asks how human wellbeing can be maintained and enhanced for the long term given rising populations, limited natural resources and a fragile environment. The field, with its clear applied focus and strong strategic, future-directed policy implications, has social sciences at its heart.</p>
<p>We therefore deliberately expose you to a broad range of material, in order to appreciate and understand interconnected perspectives, and to provide you with skills to work effectively across disciplines. You will be encouraged to review and critically evaluate approaches to research and their application, and also identify, evaluate and investigate your own research questions.</p>
<p>Compulsory modules include our innovative ‘Contemporary Debates in Sustainable Futures’ module which is taught across institutions using the University’s Access Grid facility.</p>
<p>You’ll also choose from a range of optional modules covering debates in climate change, energy policy and the environment.</p>
    
    	<p><i>The modules we outline here provide examples of what you can expect to learn on this degree course based on recent academic teaching. The precise modules available to you in future years may vary depending on staff availability and research interests, new topics of study, timetabling and student demand.</i></p>

	<h2>Course content</h2>
    <p>Our impacts on the Earth system are at such a scale that we have become a geological force. If we are to not just survive but flourish, we urgently need to create robust and practical solutions to a set of interacting global challenges.</p>
<p>These challenges span countries, regions, and academic disciplines. For example: the challenge to establish food, water, and energy security for a global population increasing towards 9 billion by the middle of this century; the urgent need to halt the rapid decline in biodiversity; the required sudden decrease of greenhouse gas emissions in order to avoid dangerous climate change. While diverse, the common thread that links these and other challenges is that these are all ultimately a challenge of systems.</p>
<p>The programme begins with a three-day residential held at <a href=""https://kaleider.com"">Kaleider Studios</a>.</p>
<p>MSc Global Sustainability Solutions has been designed to allow students from a wide range of backgrounds to immerse themselves in a transformative educational experience. No science, mathematics, or engineering prerequisites are required. Upon graduation, you will have the experience and skills to become an agent of change for a sustainable future.</p>

    <p>The MA Classics and Ancient History programme is a one year full-time programme of study at National Qualification Framework level 7. The programme can also be studied part time. The programme is further divided into units of study called ‘modules’ which are assigned a number of ‘credits’. The credit rating of a module is proportional to the total workload, with 1 credit being nominally equivalent to 10 hours of work.</p>
<p>Our flexible programme enables you to choose either a specific pathway OR a selection of modules, which may be decided after your date of entry to the MA in Classics and Ancient History.</p>

<p>This programme is available for study in both full-time and part-time formats and students can complete either the 180 credit Masters programme or the 120 credit Diploma programme. <strong>The Diploma programme </strong>contains all of the taught elements of the Masters programme and can be completed in 9 months full-time or 21 months part-time.</p>
<p>Students on the full-time MSc programme undertake the dissertation element of the programme between June and September or during the ten months following the completion of the taught element of the programme for part-time (30-months) students on the MSc programme.</p>
<p><strong>Students on the part-time 24-month fast-track variant </strong>cover the same subjects and assessments as those on the longer standard programme. They do so, however, in a shorter, more concentrated time frame. This involves attending classes on two afternoons a week (this is currently Tuesday afternoon in Year 1 and Wednesday afternoon in year 2*). It also involves attending classes on two afternoons a week for a period in the second term and starting to work on the dissertation a year earlier than those who are enrolled on the 30-month programme.</p>
<p><strong>Students on the 30-month part-time variant </strong>will generally be taught on one afternoon a week (currently Tuesday afternoon*).</p>

              <p>Third year modules are designed to build on the previous two years to enable study of specialist areas in order to gain deep knowledge, understanding and ability. You’ll choose from a range of optional modules which have been arranged so that you can select studies of a more technical nature or from a broader management track, or you can mix-and-match according to your preferences. For technically orientated modules a theme of resource assessment, power conversion design, performance monitoring and economic appraisal recurs. The remaining modules consider the more generic issues that span all the technologies or enhance your knowledge of more policy related elements of the discipline.</p>
<p>Throughout the third year you will work on an individual research project in your area of interest, under the supervision of a member of academic staff. Through your selection of options, choice of dissertation topic and choice of vacation placement, you are in control of the content of over half of your third year programme.</p>

    <p>Our BSc Psychology programme is a stimulating, flexible and contemporary programme that provides you with an excellent foundation in key areas of psychology – developmental, cognitive, biological, social, clinical and personality – together with research methods and data analysis.</p>
<p>In your first year you will explore the core principles of psychology, before you build on your strengths and interests to carry out more specialist research and study in the second and third years.</p>
<p>In your final year, you will work on an extended research project that has the potential to result in truly novel discoveries: many final year projects have subsequently formed part of published research articles.</p>
<p>You will also benefit from Psychology’s diverse range of research collaborations with colleagues in other areas of the University, such as the College of Medicine and Health, the Business School and the Law School.</p>

    <p>The BSc Psychology with Sport and Exercise Science is taught jointly by Psychology and Sport and Health Sciences. The degree provides an excellent foundation for any student interested in a career as a psychologist with a particular focus on applying those skills in the broad areas of sport, exercise and health maintenance.</p>
<p>The programme allows you to examine the complementary nature of both psychology and sport and exercise science and focuses on two significant applications of psychology: understanding the key components necessary for developing high-level skill and expertise, such as those required in sports; and understanding the effects of physical activity and exercise on behaviour, cognition, interpersonal interactions and mental health.</p>

              <p>In year one you will develop your understanding of physics and become familiar with a variety of basic mathematical tools. The concepts and phenomena you will meet are many and varied, but are united by the underlying principles of physics. In a typical week you will spend 15 hours in a formal teaching environment, and be expected to spend a further 20 hours in independent study. You will have four hours of lectures in physics, two in mathematics, one tutorial, six hours in the teaching laboratories and two hours in problem-solving classes.</p>

              <p>Year two provides a firm foundation of physics, and the principles that constitute the framework of the subject. The use of mathematics gives these principles a precise form and provides physicists with the ability to make detailed quantitative predictions. This year focuses on four main cornerstones of physics: condensed matter, quantum mechanics, electromagnetism and thermodynamics. These provide the core of most of physics and of our understanding of the evolution of our universe. The other modules in your second and subsequent years draw in part on your knowledge of this core.</p>

              <p>The final year of the programme allows you to apply the core principles in a broad range of important areas, such as Nuclear and High-Energy Particle Physics and Statistical Physics, plus advanced electromagnetism, quantum physics and condensed matter physics. There are numerous options in theoretical physics for you to choose such as Quantum Many Body Theory, and Relativity and Cosmology. You can also choose to study technologically-important areas such as Quantum Optics and Photonics, and Physical Methods in Biology and Medicine, and active research areas such as Galaxies and High Energy Astrophysics, and Nanostructures and Graphene Science. (Options are dependent on the programme of study).</p>
<p>This year also involves substantial project work. You’ll undertake extended experiments utilising a suite of equipment that includes an atomic force microscope, an infra-red spectrometer, and our own observatory and radio telescope. You also have the opportunity to undertake team-based work tackling a real-world problem proposed by local business or industry.</p>

              <p>In year one you will develop your understanding of physics and become familiar with a variety of basic mathematical tools. The concepts and phenomena you will meet are many and varied, but are united by the underlying principles of physics. In a typical week you will spend 15 hours in a formal teaching environment, and be expected to spend a further 20 hours in independent study. You will have four hours of lectures in physics, two in mathematics, one tutorial, six hours in the teaching laboratories and two hours in problem-solving classes.</p>

              <p>Year two provides a firm foundation of physics, and the principles that constitute the framework of the subject. The use of mathematics gives these principles a precise form and provides physicists with the ability to make detailed quantitative predictions. This year focuses on four main cornerstones of physics: condensed matter, quantum mechanics, electromagnetism and thermodynamics. These provide the core of most of physics and of our understanding of the evolution of our universe. The other modules in your second and subsequent years draw in part on your knowledge of this core.</p>

              <p>The final two years of this programme allows you to apply the core principles in a broad range of important areas, such as Nuclear and High-Energy Particle Physics and Statistical Physics, plus advanced electromagnetism, quantum physics and condensed matter physics. There are numerous options in theoretical physics for you to choose such as Quantum Many Body Theory, and Relativity and Cosmology. You can also choose to study technologically-important areas such as Quantum Optics and Photonics, and Physical Methods in Biology and Medicine, and active research areas such as Galaxies and High Energy Astrophysics, and Nanostructures and Graphene Science. (Options are dependent on the programme of study).</p>
<p>The final years of the programme also involve substantial project work. As part of the MPhys programme, you’ll be ‘adopted’ into one of our research groups, working in a small group (typically three or four, but with individual roles), to undertake a project for at least one academic year. You will select your preferred project from a list of short research proposals freshly written by the academics each year. The projects are original and open-ended, i.e., they each focus on a previously unstudied piece of physics. You will meet with your supervisor (a professor or lecturer) once a week to discuss progress and future work. You are also encouraged to attend research seminars from visiting speakers, attend the weekly group meetings, and integrate and socialise with the PhD students and researchers.</p>

              <p>The final year of the programme allows you to apply the core principles in a broad range of important areas, such as Nuclear and High-Energy Particle Physics and Statistical Physics, plus advanced electromagnetism, quantum physics and condensed matter physics. There are numerous options in theoretical physics for you to choose such as Quantum Many Body Theory, and Relativity and Cosmology. You can also choose to study technologically-important areas such as Quantum Optics and Photonics, and Physical Methods in Biology and Medicine, and active research areas such as Galaxies and High Energy Astrophysics, and Nanostructures and Graphene Science. (Options are dependent on the programme of study).</p>
<p>This year also involves substantial project work. You’ll undertake extended experiments utilising a suite of equipment that includes an atomic force microscope, an infra-red spectrometer, and our own observatory and radio telescope. You also have the opportunity to undertake team-based work tackling a real-world problem proposed by local business or industry.</p>

              <p>The two final years of this programme allow you to apply the core principles in a broad range of important areas, such as Nuclear and High-Energy Particle Physics and Statistical Physics, plus advanced electromagnetism, quantum physics and condensed matter physics.  There are numerous options in theoretical physics for you to choose such as Quantum Many Body Theory, and Relativity and Cosmology. You can also choose to study technologically-important areas such as Quantum Optics and Photonics, and Physical Methods in Biology and Medicine, and active research areas such as Galaxies and High Energy Astrophysics, and Nanostructures and Graphene Science. (Options are dependent on the programme of study).</p>
<p>The final years of the programme also involve substantial project work. As part of the MPhys programme, you will be ‘adopted’ into one of our research groups, working in a small group (typically three or four, but with individual roles), to undertake a project for at least one academic year. You will select your preferred project from a list of short research proposals freshly written by the academics each year. The projects are original and open-ended, i.e., they each focus on a previously unstudied piece of physics.  You will meet with your supervisor (a professor or lecturer) once a week to discuss progress and future work. You are also encouraged to attend research seminars from visiting speakers, attend the weekly group meetings, and integrate and socialise with the PhD students and researchers.</p>

	<h2>Course content</h2>
    <p>Our Nursing programme was new for 2019 entry and is a four-year course leading to an MSci Nursing degree and registration as an Adult nurse, with the possibility for some students to achieve a dual registration in Adult and Mental Health Nursing.</p>
<p>Nurses make healthcare. As healthcare is changing in the UK and around the world, the role of nurses is changing too. Nurses are occupying more and more senior positions across the healthcare sector – in management, policy-making, research and education. And, of course, nurses continue to be at the forefront of treating patients, in all sorts of settings; from working in ultra-modern super hospitals, to caring for the vulnerable at home, to providing critical support in refugee camps or countries affected by natural disasters.</p>
<p>Our aim is for Exeter Nurses to be outstanding in all areas of nursing, and healthcare more widely. The University of Exeter is committed to developing the future of nursing, and our radical vision is reflected in the structure and content of this programme.</p>
<p>The programme is structured around Exeter’s unique ‘six pillars’ of nursing: patient and public involvement; fundamental essentials of nursing care; evidence for practice; no health without mental health; leadership and management of healthcare; global health. By the time you have completed your studies you will be able to take your place anywhere as a highly professional nurse capable of leading exceptional, comprehensive, person centred and evidence-based care in a true partnership with the people you are caring for.</p>
<h3>Placements</h3>
<p>Fifty percent of your time will be spent in clinical practice. The Academy of Nursing has four key NHS practice learning partners:<br>• Devon Partnership NHS Trust (Mental Health and Learning Disability Services)<br>• Northern Devon Healthcare NHS Trust (Acute, Community and Specialist Services)<br>• Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust (Acute, Community and Specialist Integrated Healthcare Services)<br>• Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust (Acute and Community Services, Adult Social Care)</p>
<p>The three main hospitals sites that you may be placed at are: The Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital in Exeter, Torbay Hospital in Torquay and North Devon District Hospital in Barnstaple. You will also have a variety of Community and Primary Care placements throughout Devon. Additionally, there may be the opportunity for placements in the Private, Voluntary or Independent Healthcare sector.<br><br>Placements are organised in blocks that range from seven to eleven weeks. By the end of year one you will have had exposure to mental health and primary care settings, as well as two core practice placements in an acute hospital setting. By the end of year two you will have had exposure to mental health, learning disability, child, maternity and primary care settings, as well as three core practice placements in acute or community settings. You will also have the opportunity to undertake a four week elective practice learning experience, in the UK or abroad (Europe/ US/ Australia/ Central America). In years three and four you will complete two core placements each year that are relevant to your chosen programme pathway.</p>
<p><span>The modules we outline here provide examples of what you can expect to learn on this degree course based on recent academic teaching. The precise modules available to you in future years may vary depending on staff availability and research interests, new topics of study, timetabling and student demand.</span></p>

	<h2>Course content</h2>
    <p>Our Neuroscience degree has been carefully designed to share with you the latest ideas about how biological processes in nervous tissues enable the life we see around us, and experience ourselves.</p>
<p>Understanding these processes better could transform healthcare – and illuminate what it means to be human. These are substantial challenges. To meet them, we use small-group teaching throughout the course to help you develop your subject knowledge and capacity for critical thinking.</p>
<p>Underpinning this is our central commitment to research-engaged teaching. We do not want to simply share information with you; we want you to be part of the process of scientific discovery. This means that, alongside formal teaching sessions, we encourage you to become an active participant in our inter-disciplinary community. From the moment you arrive there are hands-on opportunities for you to do research.</p>

              <p>Your first year will be made up of four modules through which you’ll be introduced to interdisciplinary research, ideas and philosophy which form the basis of Natural Sciences. You’ll explore experimental science in the lab where you’ll complete a series of experiments that complement your lectures.</p>

              <p>Your third year includes two major projects. The Research Project will see you working on current research being undertaken by one of the University’s research groups and will form the first part of a two-part 90 credit project, extended over years three and four. The Group Project will involve working as a team with other third year students to complete a project of your choosing. Group projects typically involve a piece of scientific research, but could also be related to outreach, widening participation or work aimed at encouraging greater gender equality within the sciences. In addition to these projects you will choose three optional modules. An indicative list is provided below but this list is not exhaustive and you are encouraged to look at the range of modules on offer across the University.</p>
<p>During your third year, you can choose to take a Semester Abroad (60 credits), instead of the Group Project (30 credits) and two of the elective 15 credit modules.</p>

              <p>In your final year you’ll work in pairs and continue to work on the research project you started in Year 3. For the remaining duration of the project you’ll become a member of the research group, gaining a valuable insight into scientific research, but will also have an opportunity to make a real contribution to this research. In addition to this project you will have the freedom to choose 60 credits worth of optional modules.

Group projects typically involve a piece of scientific research, but could also be related to outreach, widening participation or work aimed at encouraging greater gender equality within the sciences. In addition to these projects you will choose three optional modules. An indicative list is provided below but this list is not exhaustive and you are encouraged to look at the range of modules on offer across the University.</p>

However, we understand that you may change your mind about the language you want to continue with or take up, so if you wish to change the choice of language(s) given on your UCAS application at any stage please contact either our Admissions Office who will be able to confirm whether or not you are eligible for consideration for a different language. If you do wish to be considered for an alternative language please make your request as early as possible, as capacity and planning constraints may limit our ability to allow late changes to your language choice.</p></div>

<p>The curriculum provides a clinical focus that is patient-centred, forward-thinking and meets the needs of students who want to work as doctors in an increasingly integrated, internationalised health environment. It also includes the whole health community, not just hospitals. This recognises the community role in chronic illness and prevention and provides the social context, giving you a wider perspective and understanding.</p>
<h3>Clinical placements</h3>
<p>You will gain placement experience throughout your studies. In the later years of the programme you will be immersed in the clinical environment with extensive opportunities for learning from patients as you move through the pathways of the patient care programme.</p>
<p>The community placements provide experience of the multi-professional nature of medicine and the importance of the healthcare team.</p>
<h3>Intercalation between years 4 and 5  </h3>
<p>An <a href=""http://www.exeter.ac.uk/study-dev/undergraduate/courses/medicine/medicine/#additional-section"">intercalated degree</a> provides the opportunity to explore another discipline at degree level, bringing added breadth and depth to your study. You may have the opportunity to intercalate and study 120 credits from another Bachelor’s degree (usually the final year) or a one-year Masters degree from a wide range of options available at the University of Exeter.</p>
<p>Although intercalation means an extra year of study, it can enhance the undergraduate experience by providing additional specialist knowledge and transferable skills which can be a real asset in your future professional life.</p>
<h3>Electives</h3>
<p>The electives form a very important part of the curriculum, enabling you to experience medicine in an entirely new environment, both socially and culturally. Electives may involve clinical or research placements, or a combination of both. Many students take this opportunity to see the practice of medicine in another part of the world, for example, by exploring the delivery of clinical care in developing countries, through placements in mission or government hospitals. Other students arrange elective placements within the South West or other parts of the UK. There are few restrictions on what you might wish to do, provided this is clearly set out in the context of agreed learning objectives.</p>
<h3>Foundation Year</h3>
<p>At the end of the undergraduate programme you will receive your BMBS degree, which is a primary medical qualification (PMQ). This entitles you to provisional registration with the General Medical Council. Provisionally registered doctors can only practise in approved Foundation Year 1 posts: the law does not allow provisionally registered doctors to undertake any other type of work. To obtain a Foundation Year 1 post you will need to apply during the final year of your undergraduate degree through the UK Foundation Programme Office selection scheme, which allocates these posts to graduates on a competitive basis.</p>

	<h2>Course content</h2>
    <p>Our Medical Sciences degree prioritises the science that underpins medicine and clinical practice, preparing you to translate scientific discoveries and technological advances into improved healthcare. To achieve this, the first part of the programme gives you a wide-ranging insight into how the human body normally works. We study this through small-group sessions, lectures and hands-on laboratory practicals.<br><br>We then build upon this foundation to see how things can go wrong in the body due to disease and trauma and how normal function might be restored. We are keen that you develop a holistic understanding of human health. You will then specialise in the area that interests you most, tailoring your degree to match your specific career ambitions.</p>

              <p>The emphasis is on understanding the normal functioning of the human body, from enzymes through to whole biological systems. Without this core knowledge of how the body works, it would be impossible for us, as scientists, to devise the new diagnostic tests, drugs or treatments that will best benefit patients. Modules cover human physiology, biochemistry and genetics, and microbiology and cells.</p>

<li>You are encouraged to undertake a Professional Training Year in the UK or abroad and gain invaluable experience working as part of a leading research team</li>
<li>You’ll have the option to specialise into one of four pathways with named specialism in your degree title; Health Research, Human Genomics, Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Neuroscience</li>
<li>You’ll learn through interdisciplinary small group learning, training you to think like a scientist</li>

	<h2>Course content</h2>
    <p>Our Medical Sciences degree prioritises the science that underpins medicine and clinical practice, preparing you to translate scientific discoveries and technological advances into improved healthcare. To achieve this, the first part of the programme gives you a wide-ranging insight into how the human body normally works. We study this through small-group sessions, lectures and hands-on laboratory practicals.</p>
<p>We then build upon this foundation to see how things can go wrong in the body due to disease and trauma and how normal function might be restored. We are keen that you develop a holistic understanding of human health. You will then specialise in the area that interests you most, tailoring your degree to match your specific career ambitions.</p>
<p>If you choose the Professional Training Year for this course, it will take place between your second and third (final) year.</p>

	<h2>Course content</h2>
    <p>The ocean covers 71% of the surface of the Earth, but when depth is accounted for, occupies 97% of the volume of the biosphere. This means that the sea and life within it has a profound influence on the processes which keep the planet habitable. Yet until recently the ocean has been neglected in terms of management and protection, despite growing evidence of adverse impacts from a long list of human influences, such as overfishing, habitat damage and biodiversity loss, pollution, and climate change.</p>
<p>Global attention is now turning rapidly to how to safeguard ocean life and the people and industries that depend on it, leading to increasing demand for trained practitioners of marine environmental management. MSc Marine Environmental Management delivers this training, giving you a thorough grounding in a wide diversity of marine ecosystems, their ecology, functioning, and values to people.</p>
<p>The programme explores the diverse ways in which human activities affect marine life and introduces management approaches to alleviate pressures from activities such as fisheries, tourism, coastal development and climate change. It examines in depth the science and practice of creating and managing marine protected areas to safeguard marine life and promote human livelihoods and wellbeing.</p>

    <p>At the University of Exeter we host one of the largest and most active groups of evolutionary and behavioural ecologists in the world. Our academics are at the forefront of research on animal behaviour in the lab and in the field, and work on animal populations around the globe.</p>
<p>This Masters degree is taught by the Centre for Ecology and Conservation (CEC), whose <a href=""http://biosciences.exeter.ac.uk/cec/research/"">evolutionary and behaviour research groups</a> are amongst the most dynamic in the UK. You will be integrated into these groups and conduct cutting-edge research projects that can make genuine contributions to the field of evolutionary and behavioural ecology and prepare you for a career in research.</p>
<p>The Centre is the fastest growing institute of its kind in the UK. <span>Research is almost exclusively organismal, using a range of iconic model systems in both the field and lab (from wild social mammals, birds and fish to insects and microbes) to address key questions at the fore-front of the field.</span> We also specialise in modelling animal behaviour and species interactions and see this as essential and complementary to our whole approach. The other area of emphasis which underpins much of our work is quantitative and molecular genetics, which is fundamental to the evolutionary process and to conservation biology and policy issues.</p>

	<h2>Course content</h2>
    <p>This programme examines both scientific and policy-oriented aspects of conservation. Teaching covers the breadth of this important field, examining how conservation goals may be achieved under climate change scenarios, in combination with food security requirements, while taking social justice issues into account. The breadth of the degree gives flexibility to pursue those areas most relevant to your professional development and contains a significant research component supported by leading researchers.</p>
<p>Integral to the whole programme is extensive liaison with conservation practitioners from a wide range of collaborating governmental and non-governmental organisations, as well as a broad suite of international organisations. Key individuals from some of these organisations contribute to classes and field visits and a number of our project students will be placed with such organisations.</p>
<p>A special feature of the programme is the <a href=""#fieldwork"">Kenya field course</a>. The trip provides you with opportunities to see first-hand how conservation science operates within particular policy contexts.</p>
<p>This Masters is based on the Penryn Campus in Cornwall home to the University's <a href=""/esi/"">Environment and Sustainability Institute</a> (ESI) – a £30 million centre leading cutting-edge, interdisciplinary research into solutions to problems of environmental change and enhancing people’s lives by improving their relationship with the environment.</p>

    <p>The MA in Anthrozoology will be of interest to anyone who would like to investigate the many and varied ways in which humans perceive, engage, compete and co-exist with non-human animals in a range of cultural contexts.</p>
<p>The distance learning MA Anthrozoology is especially relevant in terms of Continual Professional Development for individuals who are involved with the care of non-human animals in a professional capacity (eg, vets, veterinary nurses/technicians, animal trainers, dog wardens, zoo keepers, conservationists, charity workers etc.), as well as for students who have completed social science undergraduate degrees or who have a science background and would like to expand their research interests into the social sciences. The distance learning format is sufficiently flexible to enable you to fit it in around your existing professional and personal commitments.</p>

    <p>The first year of study guides you through the specialised language used in the analysis of film and approaches to studying film as a visual and aural art form. It familiarises you with the most important movements and moments in cinema history, introduces you to key concepts and theories, and engages with the cross-cultural and transnational exchanges between world cinemas.</p>
<p>In the second year, you will study the history of American cinema and contemporary theories of film philosophy.</p>
<p>In your final year you can pursue your own interests and develop expertise in selected areas. Choose from a wide array of specialist modules, covering topics ranging from American independent cinema, surrealist cinema, to war and visual media. You will also either write a dissertation or complete a creative dissertation video essay or short film on a topic of your choice.</p>

              <p>A key aspect of the third year is its flexibility: in addition to the core modules you’ll be able to tailor your degree to your interests. The optional modules you’ll be choosing from cover continually-evolving subjects tackling a variety of global environmental challenges. Alongside this, you will go on a ten-day residential trip to either Cyprus or Spain, focusing on applied mapping, geotechnical engineering and environmental impact.</p>

              <p>In Year 2 you will explore how physics is used to investigate the Earth’s subsurface in our geophysics module. You will also develop core geological and transferable skills that build on Year 1 knowledge by learning about sedimentary processes, volcanic and magmatic rocks, how rocks fold and fracture, and geological maps. The Independent Research Project (IRP) is a third-year module that starts in the summer period between second and third year, when you carry out four to five weeks of independent field-based research. Most of our students choose a geological mapping project, which they may do anywhere in the world.</p>

	<h2>Course content</h2>
    <p>This programme features a practical, hands-on approach to geoscience and, in particular, the fieldwork opportunities offered by being based in the landscapes and seascapes of Cornwall. Geography and Geology benefits from this context in treating Cornwall as a ‘natural laboratory’, taking learning into the field to explore the incredible diversity of rocks, environments, Earth system processes and natural landscapes in the region.</p>
<p>Residential field courses are a feature of the programme, along with one-day courses based on Cornwall’s spectacular geology and its extractive industry and associated environmental case studies.</p>
<p>Modules include a wide range of physical geography and geology specialisms, including Earth system science, petrology, stratigraphy, palaeontology, sedimentology, environmental sustainability and history, climate change, remote sensing, landscape change and hydrogeology. Teaching and research activities emphasise the value of interdisciplinary thinking, and students develop their knowledge in a supportive learning environment with small class sizes and an informal, friendly ambience.</p>

	<h2>Course content</h2>
    <p>Environmental science is a quantitative and interdisciplinary approach to understanding and managing the world in which we live. Environmental scientists are concerned with understanding spatial patterns in physical, biological and chemical phenomena in the Earth’s system at local, regional and global scales. They find appropriate solutions to environmental problems by assessing, reporting and quantifying environmental risks. They work in areas as diverse as contaminated land assessment and remediation, natural resource management, practical conservation, pollution mitigation, ecosystem service assessment, environmental monitoring, mapping and consultancy. This degree in Environmental Science will give you the skills and expertise you need to address the world’s greatest challenges in climate change, such as biodiversity, sustainability and environmental decision-making.</p>
<p>The final year provides an opportunity to work on a project focused on a specialised area of environmental professional practice or academic research. You have the choice of carrying out a detailed consultancy report, where possible in collaboration with an industrial partner, or a more traditional research project aligned with one of our leading research groups. The remainder of your time will be spent studying advanced research methods, and on a two-week intensive field course in which your scientific field-research, debating and presentation skills will be further developed.</p>
    
    	<p><i>The modules we outline here provide examples of what you can expect to learn on this degree course based on recent academic teaching.

	<h2>Course content</h2>
    <p>Environmental science is a quantitative and interdisciplinary approach to understanding and managing the world in which we live. Environmental scientists are concerned with understanding spatial patterns in physical, biological and chemical phenomena in the Earth’s system at local, regional and global scales. They find appropriate solutions to environmental problems by assessing, reporting and quantifying environmental risks. They work in areas as diverse as contaminated land assessment and remediation, natural resource management, practical conservation, pollution mitigation, ecosystem service assessment, environmental monitoring, mapping and consultancy.</p>
<p>Our degree in Environmental Science will give you the skills and expertise you need to address the world’s greatest challenges in climate change, such as biodiversity, sustainability and environmental decision-making.</p>
    
    	<p><i>The modules we outline here provide examples of what you can expect to learn on this degree course based on recent academic teaching. The precise modules available to you in future years may vary depending on staff availability and research interests, new topics of study, timetabling and student demand.</i></p>

              <p>During your first year, which is shared with all Geology students, you will gain a solid foundation in geology and the geosciences. You will undertake nine one-day field classes to iconic locations across Cornwall during terms 1 and 2, and attend a one-week residential field class in Pembrokeshire during early May.</p>

              <p>In Year 2, you will further develop core geological skills as well as your ability to collect and analyse geological data. Fieldwork includes seven one-day field classes, a residential field course in Devon and Dorset, and training in geological mapping on the Isle of Skye.</p>

              <p>A key aspect of year three teaching is its flexibility: in addition to the core modules you get to tailor your geological development to the topics which interest you most. The optional modules you’ll be choosing from cover a selection of continually-evolving subjects tackling a variety of global environmental challenges. The ‘Engineering Geology field course’ provides an opportunity to examine an outstanding area of geology famous for its tectonic and mining history, and typically cycles between Spain and Cyprus.</p>

              <p>In your final year everything you have learnt in your Computer Science studies comes together in a significant piece of individual project work. The project, in which you’ll develop a substantial software system for scientific and/or business use. This forms the core of the final year and allows you to develop your skills and interests in computer science. The wide range of optional modules in your third year allows you to tailor your degree towards your specific interests.</p>

	<h2>Course content</h2>
    <p>This is a flexible degree programme, giving you the option to design either a broad-based biology degree or a more focused degree specialising in areas of biology which interest you. You will have the opportunity to follow one of three specialisms – animal biology, microbiology and infectious disease or molecular and cellular biology – and graduate with your chosen specialism named as part of your degree title, eg, BSc Biological Sciences (Animal Biology).</p>
<p>After a foundation first year, which covers the range of biology from molecules to ecosystems, you have complete freedom of module choice in your second and final years. Options range from forensic science to the ecology of environmental change; from mammalian biology to microbiology; from human molecular biology to a coral reef field course. Shape your degree as you wish – following one of the named specialisms outlined below, or in other areas, whilst keeping your biological choices broad.</p>
    
    	<p><i>The modules we outline here provide examples of what you can expect to learn on this degree course based on recent academic teaching. The precise modules available to you in future years may vary depending on staff availability and research interests, new topics of study, timetabling and student demand.</i></p>

<ul>
<li>BSc Biological Sciences (Animal Biology)</li>
<li>BSc Biological Sciences (Microbiology and Infectious Disease)</li>
<li>BSc Biological Sciences (Molecular and Cellular Biology) </li>
</ul>
<p>To qualify for one of the named specialisms you must study sufficient relevant specialist modules from within the core programme. You need to study at least 90 credits, spread across your second year and final year, from the selection of specialist modules below, including at least 60 credits from non-project/dissertation modules.</p>
<p>You will receive advice about the specialisms once you’re at Exeter so you don’t need to make any decisions in advance.</p>
<p>Please refer to the Year 2 and Final year dropdowns above for full module details. </p>

	<h2>Course content</h2>
    <p>The four-year MSci Biological and Medicinal Chemistry programme mirrors the <a href=""/undergraduate/courses/biosciences/biomed/"">BSc Biological and Medicinal Chemistry</a> during the first three years, but also includes an additional fourth year during which you will undertake a research project. This will focus on a specialised area aligned with one of our leading research groups. You will also undertake advanced modules in your final year.</p>
<p>This popular degree provides training in both biological sciences and chemistry and shows how this multidisciplinary area relates to aspects of medicine and drug design.</p>
<p>Chemistry is at the core of the degree, with options in biochemistry and biology. An emphasis is given to understanding the chemistry and synthesis of small molecules, particularly in medicine and disease.</p>
    
    	<p><i>The modules we outline here provide examples of what you can expect to learn on this degree course based on recent academic teaching. The precise modules available to you in future years may vary depending on staff availability and research interests, new topics of study, timetabling and student demand.</i></p>

    <p>This degree provides training in both biological sciences and chemistry and shows how this multidisciplinary area relates to aspects of medicine and drug design.</p>
<p>Chemistry is at the core of the degree, with options in biochemistry and biology. An emphasis is given to understanding the chemistry and synthesis of small molecules, particularly in medicine and disease.</p>
<p>The first year provides an excellent grounding in all three branches of chemistry – inorganic, organic and physical. Organic chemistry remains a key element in subsequent years of the programme, with an emphasis being the clear link between chemistry and biological sciences. The level and breadth of coverage of organic chemistry is comparable with that normally encountered in a Single Honours BSc Chemistry programme.</p>
<p>The second and final years provide you with a wide range of module choice allowing further specialisation in chemistry, forensic science, cell biology, molecular biology and genomics, and biotechnology, alongside core topics including pharmacology, medicinal chemistry and drug design.</p>

    <p>The four-year MSci Biochemistry programme mirrors the <a href=""/undergraduate/courses/biosciences/biochem/"">BSc Biochemistry</a> programme during the first three years, but also includes an additional fourth year during which you will undertake a research project. This will focus on a specialised area aligned with one of our leading research groups. You will also undertake advanced modules in your final year.</p>
<p>The degree programme in Biochemistry focuses on understanding the biochemical control of biological processes, particularly in the cell, and the tools for investigating these mechanisms. After a broad first year, this degree focuses on cellular biochemistry providing specialist modules aimed at understanding key topics at the frontiers of cell biology. As you progress through years two and three, a wide choice of biochemistry module options are available.</p>
    
    	<p><i>The modules we outline here provide examples of what you can expect to learn on this degree course based on recent academic teaching. The precise modules available to you in future years may vary depending on staff availability and research interests, new topics of study, timetabling and student demand.</i></p>

    <p>The four-year MSci Animal Behaviour programme mirrors the <a href=""/undergraduate/courses/biosciences/animal/"">BSc Animal Behaviour</a> programme during the first three years, but also includes an additional fourth year during which you will undertake a research project, an advanced statistical modelling module and a literature review. The research project will focus on a specialised area aligned with one of our leading research groups. The remainder of your time will be spent on a two-week intensive field course in which your scientific field-research, debating, and presentation skills will be further developed.</p>
<p>Throughout this programme you will be exposed to a wide range of theoretical and practical techniques used to study animal behaviour. We will provide you with the skills, concepts and experience to understand all aspects of animal behaviour. The programme covers the evolution and adaptive function of behaviour in the wild, its physiological and neuronal control, and how animals develop socially and cognitively through experience.</p>
