<p><strong>Alternative Entry Approaches</strong></p>
<p>Here at DMU we recognise the commitment and achievement required to take part in national cadet programmes, particularly those with a focus on health and first aid, such as Ambulance Cadets. Where an applicant can demonstrate over two years of commitment to a cadet programme (considered from the age of 15+), supported by a letter of recommendation from their Unit Manager, Youth Team or Officer-in-Charge, we will accept this in lieu of 32 UCAS points (equivalent to a C grade at A-level). The remaining UCAS points will need to be gained through academic study. GCSE requirements still apply.</p>
<p><b style=""font-size: 0.875rem;"">Interview:</b> Yes</p>
<p>The recruitment process for this course includes assessing applicants by the content of their personal statement and interview for the <span style=""font-size: 0.875rem; background-color: #ffffff;"">core values </span>of the NHS constitution.</p>
<p>The interview will include a numeracy test (set to GCSE grade C in maths) and a literacy test (again set to GCSE grade C in English).</p>
<p>There is no fitness test, but you are expected to be able to lift, move and carry patients. </p>
<p>Professional conduct during the event will also contribute to the decision-making regarding an applicant’s application.</p>
<p>There is no routine fitness test, but you are expected to be able to lift, move and carry patients. Candidates may be invited to undertake a trade (fitness) test where concerns about capability are identified by occupational health screening questionnaires and this will form part of the decision whether a candidate is offered a place or not.</p>

</div>","If you’re passionate about supporting your community, with the aptitude to keep calm under pressure and work as part of a team to make important decisions, then working as an ambulance technician could be a really enriching career choice. As an ambulance technician, you’ll be working alongside the paramedic a team of ambulance clinicians to support and assess patients. This diploma course is designed to teach you how to apply your knowledge and compassion to become a thoughtful and skilled healthcare professional. Our diploma course will educate you in many elements of clinical sciences and practice to be able to handle emergency and urgent healthcare situations.,You will study a range of topics taught by both paramedic lecturers and other healthcare professionals, including midwives, nurses and doctors, which means your learning will benefit from expert knowledge from those with real experience of working in the healthcare sector. Practical experience is gained by working alongside senior paramedics and experienced technicians on emergency ambulances and rapid response cars. You will also benefit from real-world experience in a number of wider community-based placements, for example in an emergency department or medical centre. Upon completion of this course you’ll gain access to our BSc (Hons) Paramedicine programme through our accredited prior learning pathway.","<div>

</div>","English is a global language that’s rich in history. In this course you will immerse yourself in the form, culture and analysis of the English language and learn to make the connections between what you study at university and what takes place in the world beyond the classroom. Combining your studies with another related subject will broaden your outlook and skillset and open up even more career opportunities.,We live in a modern world governed and connected by technology. So alongside understanding the history of English and how it’s become an international language, we believe you should study the nature of the 'wired' environment and how it influences who you are. As part of our approach to digital humanities, you will have the opportunity to see how communication and language operate on web-based platforms, and how the application of digital tools and methods can deepen the knowledge of your chosen subject area.  ","<div>

<div class=""structureContent"">
<div class=""small-6 medium-6 large-6 columns"">

<p><b>First year</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Computer Programming I</b> – This module introduces the skills required to develop a computer program to solve a given problem and does so from the perspective of designing trustworthy software with an emphasis on sound coding principles.</li>
<li><b>Computer Programming II</b> – Computer programming requires the analysis of a problem, the production of requirements, and their translation into a design that can be executed on a computer. The design phase in particular requires the identification and combination of appropriate programming abstractions. This module introduces the skills required to analyse a problem to produce a program specification, and to be able to test solutions to ensure they are trustworthy.</li>
<li><b>Computer Ethics</b> – The module introduces students to the ethical theories affecting cyber security, software engineering, computer science and digital forensics. It requires them to develop critical analytical skills in applying ethical theories to technological outcomes regarding cyber security, software engineering, computer science and digital forensics.</li>
<li><b>Computer Law and Cyber Security</b> – The module introduces students to the legal and professional context of cyber security, software engineering, computer science and digital forensics, it addresses legal framework, legal and professional responsibilities of the software engineer, systems manager, computer forensic and security practitioner. The module will address computer ethics, data protection law, UK and international law affecting cyber security, digital engineering, systems management and digital forensics</li>
<li><b>Computer Systems</b> – This module provides a foundation in computer architecture and operating systems with a specific emphasis on their security. Students will learn about computer hardware, software, operating systems, and demonstrate practical knowledge of these during lab sessions. Studying this module student will be able to relate the abstract concepts of logic and number systems to their concrete representation on real machines and identify the security risks in common configurations of computer operating systems and suggest appropriate mitigations. In the practical lab sessions students will also learn to develop shell scripts.</li>
<li><b>Computer Networks</b> – This module provides a foundation in modern computer networks with a specific emphasis on their security. Students studying this module will be able to explain how modern computer networks functions and be able to demonstrate a practical knowledge of computer networking. Students will be able to identify security risks in common configurations of computer networks and suggest appropriate mitigations.</li>
<li><b>Mathematics for Computing</b> – Mathematical structures are introduced that provide a basis for computer science. Specific topics include logic, set theory, probability and statistics.</li>
<li><b>Database Design and Implementation</b> – Structured data, held in relational databases, accessed via SQL, supports the information storage requirements of many companies, organisations, and on-line businesses. In this module the student will learn the fundamentals of how to design the structure of data within a relational database, how to interact with data within the database, and how to protect the data within the database.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

</div>
<div class=""small-6 medium-6 large-6 columns"">

<p><b>Second year modules:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Software and Security Management</b> – This module introduces the business contexts within which IT projects are procured and developed. This includes the feasibility of computer system development viewed from economic, technical, social, legal, and ethical perspectives. The module covers risk factors and risk assessment during different phases of the lifecycle, and introduces students to the techniques used both to measure and to ensure software quality including processes covering the management and design of trustworthy software (BS PAS744 Software Trustworthiness). </li>
<li><b>Object Oriented Design</b> – This module focuses on Object-Oriented (OO) library development and enables students to design, implement, and test medium scale software systems using an object-oriented approach. The design notation used is the Unified Modelling Language (UML) and the implementation language is Java. It is essentially a programming module, with the emphasis on implementing OO designs and producing reusable libraries.<br><br></li>
<li><b>Object Oriented Development</b> – This module focuses on Object-Oriented (OO) application development using the extensive library packages provided by the Java Software Development Kit (SDK). Students enrolling on this module will have already been introduced to key principles of OO class design such as encapsulation and different associations including inheritance. This knowledge will be useful in helping to navigate and make use of a variety of domains within the standard edition API, e.g. Collections, Input/Output, and Graphical User Interfaces. <br><br></li>
<li><b>Web Application Development</b> – This module provides a firm technical foundation of how a web application can be developed that allows web users to interact with assets stored in databases. <br> Modern web applications typically make heavy use of server-side scripting . A server-side scripting language that has achieved prominence over recent years has been PHP. This pragmatic language is used to great effect by some web developers and with catastrophic naivety by others. Rudimentary web application penetration testing will introduced in order to emphasise the hostile attention that public facing web content will attract. It is assumed that students are already competent programmers, prior to starting this module.</li>
<li><b>Agile Team Development</b> – This module is an opportunity for students to engage in a constrained work-place simulation based on agile software development. Students working in teams of 3 to 5 will initially identify a system of sufficient size to be distributed equally among all members. Work allocation will be monitored under the guidance of their tutor/supervisor. For example each team member might take individual ownership of the development of 2-3 classes from initial inception to completion providing CRUD functionality. In the case of a large system this may mean that some aspects of the system are never built to completion.</li>
<li><b>Data Structures and Algorithms</b> – This module introduces a variety of data structures and algorithms for sequential execution. Classical data structures will be introduced (including stacks, queues, lists, trees, and hash tables) and algorithms for searching and sorting. The performance characteristics of these data structures and algorithms will be explained. Specific coding issues will also be considered such as modularity, genericity, equality, assignment, mutable and immutable objects.</li>
<li><b>Concurrent and Parallel Algorithms</b> – The module will introduce students to concurrent program design in the context of multi-core architectures and distributed applications. Where appropriate formal notation will be used for specification.</li>
<li><b>Introduction to Research</b> – The module provides the student with an understanding of the importance of researching, analysing, and interpreting existing literature and other documents in order to establish a solid context in which research and development questions can be developed and subsequently investigated. It develops the student's research skills, and particularly skills related to identifying relevant literature from a variety of sources, critically analysing academic and non-academic texts, and justifying a set of research or development questions in a particular topic area. The module explores these research methods through the lens of ethics in technology, introducing students to key ethical issues in relation to information systems, such as privacy, autonomy, security, identity, and social impact.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Third year modules:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Computing Project</b> – The project provides students with the opportunity to carry out a significant piece of work involving critical analysis and reflection to provide an effective solution to a given technical and/or research-based problem. It enables students to apply and integrate previous material covered on the student's course as well as to extend the work covered on the course through research and self-learning. Students will be expected to demonstrate appropriate and proactive project management, and written/verbal presentation skills throughout the period of the project. As well as analysing, designing, delivering and appraising a product of suitable quality, they will be expected to undertake, research, analyse, design, evaluate and report on some aspects of a subject explicitly allied to the project.</li>
<li><b>Systems Building: Methods</b> – This module covers an important aspect of Information Systems Development (ISD): the selection and evaluation of methodologies used in the Systems Development process. <br><br></li>
<li><b>Rigorous Systems</b> – This module introduces the role of formal systems in rigorous software development and develops base-level skills using a contemporary formal method. The module covers the essential theoretical material (rationale, syntax, semantics) and provides practical experience using an appropriate software development tool. <br> The module is based on the formal specification language ITL.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Optional modules:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fuzzy Logic and Knowledge Based Systems</strong></li>
<li><b>Secure Web Application Development</b> – This module assumes a sound understanding of PHP. This will have been gained through previous study or significant commercial experience of web development. <br> Many modern computer services are now accessed via the ubiquitous web-browser, and users have come to expect instant and secure access to information on a wide range of platforms. Underpinning these web systems is usually a web application, providing a channel to data stored in databases. However, increasingly the web-site has also become a point of entry for unauthorised access to stored data. This is often the result of poor web application design and/or implementation. <br> The module considers how a web application may be designed and implemented in such a way as to reduce the likelihood of unauthorised access to information. This also requires an understanding of the more common forms of browser-based attacks and the coding techniques that can be used to defend against these.</li>
<li><b>Web Application Penetration Testing</b> – Web Application Penetration Testing aims to unearth the vulnerable areas in web applications before the hackers do. Basing the testing upon a recognised methodology helps to ensure that the majority of well known vulnerabilities are discovered and mitigation implemented before potentially disastrous consequences occur.</li>
<li><b>Telematics</b></li>
<li><b>Multi-service Networks I</b></li>
<li><b>Multi-service Networks II</b></li>
<li><b>Functional Software Development</b></li>

<p><br>Research Log – The students will open a research log of their experience of moving through the various parts of the programme in relation to their professional lives. An indicative template and guidance will be provided to students. The log should have regular brief entries (at least every two weeks) and provide a commentary and reflection on making sense of the doctoral, work and general life experiences. The log does not employ academic references unless the student wishes to engage with particular sources as a part of the log and its experiences.<br><br>This log will operate, and be maintained, for the duration of the programme and will be submitted alongside the final thesis programme upon submission (minimum 2000 words in overall length). The student must receive a ‘pass’ mark for this element (pass threshold for progression). Non-achievement of a pass mark will require a resubmission of the log element.<br><br>Establishment of, and Engagement in, Action-Learning Sets - Action learning sets will be formed at the commencement of the programme.

<p>Researcher Development Programme -<strong> </strong>Throughout the course of the programme, students will have the possibility of undertaking modules from the extensive suite of available modules provided by the Graduate School Office/Doctoral College. This facility will provide a diverse range of opportunities for students to complement and supplement their learning. If students wish to take these modules they will be supported in contacted the appropriate contact points and accessing them. The modules are in addition to the validated programme and not part of it. They are undertaken entirely on the volition of the student but the course team will support and advise students in concert with colleagues from wider areas.</p>
<p>The programme structure allows students to complete the three input modules in year 1. Students who wish to complete the modules at a different pace will have two options: first, to submit outstanding assignments later in a negotiated extension timeline; secondly, - should they be unable to attend delivery of one of the three modules in the first year (due to private/professional circumstances) - to attend, for example, one or two modules in year 1 and join the new cohort in the following year 2 to undertake the remaining module(s) then. This pattern of three modules running each year will also allow students to catch up (on a cyclical /conveyor belt model) on resits should they not complete in year one or fail a first attempt. Students must successfully complete the assignments within the first two years of programme before being able to transfer to, and commence with, the thesis phase.</p>
<p>From the beginning of the programme students will also be obligated to keep and make entries in a <strong>Research Log</strong> which will operate on a yearly assessment basis throughout the duration of the programme (more is detailed below on the Log).</p>

<h4><strong>Researcher Development, Review and Assessment</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Training Needs Analysis</strong><br>During the probationary period, you will carry out a Training Needs Analysis (TNA) in order to personalise the range of skills development in research required for your project . You will complete this within three months of enrolment for full-time students and six months for part-time students. A range of compulsory and optional courses from the Researcher Development Programme form the basis of the TNA, which can be supplemented according to your specific needs (eg in languages, technical skills, etc). The TNA is submitted online with the support of your supervisor.</p>
<p><strong>Formal Review</strong><br>All research students registered on the Doctoral Researcher Programme carry out a Formal Review to confirm PhD as their award aim (This does not apply if you are studying for the MA/MSc by Research or if you are aiming for an MPhil). The Formal Review submission includes a detailed review of literature relevant to your topic along with discussion of your proposed research methods and work you have undertaken to that point—such as data collection and/or analysis, as well as your plans for the work required to complete your project. Students completing practice-based PhDs (for example where artistic creation is part of the research methodology) will also submit examples of practical work completed to that point.</p>
<p><strong>Annual Review</strong><br>A formal Annual Review Panel is held to discuss in detail your proposed research objectives for the following year and the research project achievements of the previous year.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Reports</strong><br>Online progress reports are required at least once a month. As a research student you are required to discuss your work regularly with your supervisors as an essential part of the teaching and learning contract between you and the University. These Progress Reports are an important record of the interactions you have with your supervisors and really help keep your work on track to successful completion.</p>
<h4>Completion Period</h4>
<p><strong>Thesis Submission</strong><br>The submission of your thesis for examination is be accompanied by a thesis submission form which confirms the originality of the work. You will complete this form when your thesis is submitted to the Graduate School Office (GSO).</p>
<p><strong>The Viva Voce Examination</strong><br>All research degree students undergo an oral examination, the ‘viva voce’, which takes place after you have submitted your thesis to the GSO. The examination team consists of at least two academics with significant expertise in your field. Normally there will be one internal examiner (a member of staff of the University) and an external examiner who is chosen for their particular experience and academic status.. Your first supervisor will take responsibility for arranging the viva voce examination once the nominated examiners have been approved by your Faculty and the Director of Graduate School.</p>
<p><strong>Contact Hours</strong><br>Full-time research degree students are expected to undertake at least 35 hours a week of study throughout the year. Part-time students are expected to undertake 12 hours per week. This will include meeting regularly with your supervisor, as set out in the Code of Practice for Research Degree Students.</p>

<h4>Modules</h4>
<p><em><strong>Semester one</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Research Methods for Creative Practice</strong><br>This module provides a grounding in research methods for creative technologies projects, offering students methodologies and techniques to support and develop their learning throughout their course of study.  The module will cover research methods across art and design, humanities and technology. Students will be given techniques in methods of collaborative and cooperative working as well as systems of the development of creative ideas and research.</p>
<p><strong>Digital Technologies for Arts Practice A/Digital Technologies for Arts Practice B</strong><br>These modules provide a practical understanding of a range of different digital technologies through workshops and lectures delivered by established practitioners in the field and will be assessed through a negotiated group project, where students work collaboratively to produce a piece of digital artwork.</p>
<p><strong>Digital Arts Seminar I</strong><br>This module serves as a forum for the survey and discussion of important theoretical texts and examples of practice in the field of digital arts. Students will identify an area of interest, and make a research presentation of their own practical interests in the context of the texts/practices discussed in the seminar, helping them to situate their practice in relation to research in the broader field, and to share their discoveries with a diverse group of practitioners.</p>
<p><em><strong>Semester two</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Professional Practice Workshop</strong><br>This module will give students a practical understanding of the different methods of dissemination, presentation and communication of practice/research/projects in creative technologies as well as practical experience in presenting their research to a range of audiences.  It will cover types of research outputs and dissemination, research presentation formats, ways to present and market research to different audience types, communication and presentation techniques, and project planning, culminating in an assessed showcase event for both public and private audiences.</p>
<p><strong>Digital Arts Practice A/Digital Arts Practice B</strong><br>These modules will continue to expose students to new technologies for digital arts practice, as in Digital Technologies for Arts Practice, while shifting the focus from collaborative exploratory workshops to the pursuit of developing individuals’ creative interests in practice. The module will be taught through workshops, tutorials, and critique/presentation of individual projects. Students will be assessed on the bodies of practical work produced in the module.</p>
<p><strong>Digital Arts Seminar II</strong><br>This module serves as a forum for the survey and discussion of important theoretical texts and examples of practice in the field of digital arts. Toward the middle of the semester, the students will become responsible for selecting texts and practices for discussion and leading sessions.

Employment Relations studies how these parties to the employment relationship engage with each other and how this engagement is shaped by wider economic, social, political and cultural/ideological forces.

<p>Topics to be covered will be drawn from the following themes: nation and state in History; global and transnational histories; empires and colonies; orientalism and occidentalism; social history, structuralism and the Annales; history from below; history in numbers; cultural history and postmodernism; materiality and visual history; gender history; and migration history.</p>
<p><b>Public History and Heritage<br></b>This module provides an introduction to Public History and Heritage. It will develop your knowledge about the debates, theoretical underpinnings and development of public history and heritage in both the UK and the wider world. It will enable you to engage in debates around how public history is constructed, contested and represented in society. It examines the growth in the heritage industry and considers the ways in which the digital age has impacted upon the development and growth of this sector. The module also brings together an array of industry specialists to provide a practical and theoretical approach to teaching and learning on this module.</p>
<p><strong>Global Leicester</strong> <br>The city of Leicester is one of the most diverse cities in Europe. It is shaped by both by its long migration history and also by its position as a post-industrial city in the Midlands. Using Global Leicester as the pivotal point, this module will emphasise the importance of place and scale while drawing on multiple themes. The module is designed to unpack local history through global lenses. The module will consider the multiple ways in which we can understand the history of migration through and beyond the axis of Leicester. For example, the complex relationship with the empire and the subsequent population movement due to the expulsion Asians in Uganda. The changing landscape of both the physical city and the demographic movement of people via themes of food, empire, football, trade, material objects. The themes will reflect and draw upon the expertise currently in History and more broadly research which has explored the wider ramifications of migration through the ages to present-day Leicester. The students will be encouraged to approach some of these themes and ideas through leading individual discussions and presenting a focused research case study.</p>
<p><b>Conference Training and Presentation<br></b>The module is designed to train students in the skills involved in event organisation and presentation. It will involve collaborative as well as individual research skills. Students will be guided through the necessary training in organising a conference, choosing a topic and delivering a relevant paper. Students will be assigned roles (treasurer, programme developer, marketing manager, website designer) and will also present a paper at the conference. Students will be assessed on a reflective essay, outlining their contribution to the management of the conference and a written version of their presentation (including slides). Please visit the Conference Twitter handle <a class=""sys_16"" onclick=""void(window.open('https://twitter.com/DMUHumsConf','','toolbar=yes,menubar=yes,location=yes,scrollbars=yes,status=yes,resizable=yes'));return false;"" onkeypress=""void(window.open('https://twitter.com/DMUHumsConf','','toolbar=yes,menubar=yes,location=yes,scrollbars=yes,status=yes,resizable=yes'));return false;"" href=""https://twitter.com/DMUHumsConf"">@DMUHumsConf</a> to sample previous years’ conferences.</p>
<p><b>Dissertation<br></b>The final project will be a sustained piece of writing, amounting to 15,000 words.  The piece will draw on research undertaken throughout the year but will provide a new and sustained argument.</p>

A range of compulsory and optional courses from the Researcher Development Programme form the basis of the TNA, which can be supplemented according to your specific needs (eg in languages, technical skills, etc). The TNA is submitted online with the support of your supervisor.</p>
<p><strong>Formal Review</strong><br>All research students registered on the Doctoral Researcher Programme carry out a Formal Review to confirm PhD as their award aim (This does not apply if you are studying for the MA/MSc by Research or if you are aiming for an MPhil). The Formal Review submission includes a detailed review of literature relevant to your topic along with discussion of your proposed research methods and work you have undertaken to that point—such as data collection and/or analysis, as well as your plans for the work required to complete your project. Students completing practice-based PhDs (for example where artistic creation is part of the research methodology) will also submit examples of practical work completed to that point.</p>
<p><strong>Annual Review</strong><br>A formal Annual Review Panel is held to discuss in detail your proposed research objectives for the following year and the research project achievements of the previous year.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Reports</strong><br>Online progress reports are required at least once a month. As a research student you are required to discuss your work regularly with your supervisors as an essential part of the teaching and learning contract between you and the University. These Progress Reports are an important record of the interactions you have with your supervisors and really help keep your work on track to successful completion.</p>
<h4>Completion Period</h4>
<p><strong>Thesis Submission</strong><br>The submission of your thesis for examination is be accompanied by a thesis submission form which confirms the originality of the work. You will complete this form when your thesis is submitted to the Graduate School Office (GSO).</p>
<p><strong>The Viva Voce Examination</strong><br>All research degree students undergo an oral examination, the ‘viva voce’, which takes place after you have submitted your thesis to the GSO. The examination team consists of at least two academics with significant expertise in your field. Normally there will be one internal examiner (a member of staff of the University) and an external examiner who is chosen for their particular experience and academic status.. Your first supervisor will take responsibility for arranging the viva voce examination once the nominated examiners have been approved by your Faculty and the Director of Graduate School.</p>
<p><strong>Contact Hours</strong><br>Full-time research degree students are expected to undertake at least 35 hours a week of study throughout the year. Part-time students are expected to undertake 12 hours per week. This will include meeting regularly with your supervisor, as set out in the Code of Practice for Research Degree Students.</p>

<h4>Year 1</h4>

<p><b><i>Leadership Practicum</i></b></p>
<p>This module will provide a novel and leading edge perspective on leadership in contemporary organisational contexts. It will allow you to explore a range of perspectives on leadership looking at, for example, conventional trait and situational theories of leadership and considering these in comparison with more facilitative, relational and discursive approaches such as, transformational, charismatic and distributive leadership.  Additionally, this work will be underpinned with coaching and mentoring and the module will provide rich and varied opportunities for you to contextualise your experiences.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b><i>Financial Decision Making</i></b></p>
<p>The Financial Decision Making module considers the dynamics of numerical data and information and your role in current business and management practices and business development. It will be delivered through a combination of face-to-face tutoring and distance learning and at different levels, in order to respond to different participant pre-accomplishment and ability. The module will employ case studies which illustrate how to interpret and effectively utilise financial information in a manner which adds value to business decisions and integrates financial information in the light of the realities of business strategy shaping in the contemporary era.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b><i>Strategy in Turbulent Times</i></b></p>
<p>The module will use a simulation and the teaching will be based around various aspects of understanding of the questions and situations generated. Business analytics will be covered during this module together with opportunities to work with techniques on real case studies and live business issues. The module will take you through conventional linear representations of strategy and progress to demonstrate and provide hands-on experience, through relating this back to your own professional experiences, to more incremental, complex and transformational approaches. Crucially, you will learn why strategies fail and succeed.</p>

</div>
<div class=""small-12 medium-6 large-6 columns"">

<h4>Year 2</h4>

<p><b><i>Social Entrepreneurship and Innovation in New Settings</i></b></p>
<p>This module allows you to explore your academic and professional experiences in a novel context and engage in innovative and entrepreneurial behaviours. The work of the module is constructed around a number of ‘Sustainable Development Goals’. Current business challenges point at the need for new ways of thinking and new solutions. Such approaches can also be a driver for wider social change. The module introduces you to models and debates in the field of social entrepreneurship and social innovation, and examines some of the realities of rendering these operational. This module will also integrate research methods and field research, such as the field business project at Chiang Mai (Thailand). The team have access to a wide range of potential projects including, for example, Cocoa supply change management.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b><i>Business and Sustainability</i></b></p>
<p>Sustainability presents a contemporary domain in which organisations and business are obligated to balance constraints and pressures from both internal and external sources. Senior organisational figures and executives feel compelled to behave appropriately and therein resides a challenge – how to keep up-to-date with the latest information and research when resources in terms of time and work pressures are scarce. This module addresses the need for current and relevant research delivered in an applied manner so as to build and reinforce effectiveness, judgement and confidence in the contested area of business and sustainability. The module will be mindful of being presented without jargon yet will use and contextualise leading edge research with a view to stimulating novel and critical reflection on issues which are central and critical to organizational international business policy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b><i>Future of Work and Organizations</i></b></p>
<p>This module is a capstone for the course. You will examine a wide range of stimulating and interesting topics emerging around, for example, the impact of artificial intelligence, crowdfunding, social enterprises, and virtual organisations. The module will include a series of company visits with the possibility of inter-institutional collaborative seminars. Students will relate the material of the module to the other modules of the programme drawing out inter-disciplinary and cross-modular themes and learning.</p>

<h4>Modules</h4>
<p><strong>Term one</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction to Urban Design  </strong>                                                                         </p>
<p>The module introduces the subject of urban design including key theories and concepts relative to urban design research and practice. The content is constructively aligned with an assignment that is based upon an urban design project.</p>
<p><strong>Research Methods and Urban Design Theory</strong></p>
<p>The module involves focussed study of classic urban design text(s). Study is led by small group seminars in which tutors facilitate informed debate and discussion based upon directed research. The seminars prepare students for a written assignment that requires critical analysis of a key text.</p>
<p><strong>International Design Research Studio</strong></p>
<p>The module offers students studio-based learning focussed upon a design ‘project’ or ‘challenge’. The ‘project’ will be devised in response to ‘live’ context in a UK city, and address issues that resonate with international, topical urban pressures and issues. The module content introduces techniques, methods and skills which are then revisited in the Semester 2 design studio module; it prepares the student for the Semester 2 design studio module.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 0.875rem;"">Term two</strong></p>
<p><strong>Urban Design Studio</strong></p>
<p>The module introduces Urban Design as a set of practices drawn from the fields of Architecture, Landscape Architecture, and Urban Planning. This is primarily a studio-based module. Studio exercises are constructed around case studies, models, and scenarios within which students develop both a technical proficiency with, and a conceptual understanding of, design as tool for transforming urban contexts.</p>
<p><strong>Comprehensive Dissertation</strong></p>
<p>The Dissertation allows students an opportunity to undertake a detailed investigation of a chosen architectural topic.</p>
<p>(Optional: Year Industry Placement between term 2 and term 3)</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Term three</strong></p>
<p><strong>Urban Design Thesis</strong></p>
<p>This ‘Major Project’ Module offers opportunity for students to demonstrate clearly that they have exercised initiative, personal responsibility, complex decision making and have acted autonomously in planning and implementing tasks at a professional level. The module has two pathways: whilst both focus upon ‘design’, one offers opportunity to conclude your studies in an extensive written thesis, whilst the other offers opportunity to conclude your studies in a thesis comprising of drawn/ modelled/ illustrated outputs in combination with a shorter written text.</p>

<h4>Modules</h4>
<p>The course comprises of four taught modules, plus a 15,000 word dissertation on a subject of your choice selected in consultation with your tutor. </p>
<p><strong>Social and Cultural Themes of Sport</strong><br>This module examines the development of sport and physical culture in Britain and continental Europe from the 1850s. This includes the emergence of amateurism and the on-going tension between the amateur ethos and the commercialisation of sport as well as the codification, modernisation and globalisation of sporting practices. Particular reference is made to the importance of social divisions, such as class, gender and race.<br><br><strong>Sport, Politics and Policy</strong><br>This module examines the relationship between sport and international politics, and looks at how government public policies have impacted on sport and explores identity politics in sport. The module is based around the history of mega-events such as the Olympic Games and also global sporting institutions like the International Olympic Committee and FIFA. In addition, sport in the Cold War is also examined.<br><br><strong>Investigating Sports History: Research Methods</strong><br>The primary aim of this module is to prepare students for their dissertation. It comprises two mandatory essays a Primary Source Analysis and a Dissertation Plan for which you will receive expert guidance, concerning historiography and methodology.</p>
<p>In addition, to help you specialise, you will choose one from the following:</p>
<p><strong>Sport, Writing and History </strong><br>The module considers written social and cultural aspects of the representation of sport in Britain and in an international context. The central aim is to promote appreciation of an historical approach to imaginative literature and non-fiction including autobiography, sports journalism and popular writing. This will enable students better to identify and explain long-term changes in the representation of sport and recreation and its transmission to a wide range of readers and audiences. </p>
<p><strong>Football: Past and Present</strong><br>This module explores the history of the game, from its origins, and its development from both domestic and international perspectives. It is arranged both thematically and chronologically and includes: the origins of football; the early professionalization and commercialisation of the game; the emergence of international football; football and the media; the football manager; football fans; the modernisation of football and global actors, such as FIFA. <br><br><strong>The History of Rugby</strong><br>This module examines the social history of rugby, starting in the mid-19 century and the popularisation of the sport through Tom Brown’s Schooldays to the 1995 professionalisation of rugby union. Using film, oral history and primary sources, the module examines the development of the sport through the perspectives of class, gender and national identity. At each stage the history of the sport is related to the broader history of British society in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.</p>

<h4>Module overview</h4>
<p><strong>Researching as a Writer</strong><strong> 1: Icebergs and Audience</strong></p>
<p>This is one of two six-week creative writing research modules. The main focus is on research related to writerly craft. It takes as its focus Hemingway’s model of the iceberg that the reader only sees one-eighth of. Students will understand, through practice, what the other seven-eighths consists of in terms of the practical, historical, and speculative research necessary to bring a piece of creative writing to life for a reader.  It will involve looking at how writers build worlds, characters and stories, how they research settings, time periods and ideas. We’ll consider the use of archives, mood boards, video resources, images, paintings, newspapers, other fictional texts, websites, wider reading and experiences to aid them in creation of believable worlds, characters and stories, imagery, voice, or supplementary knowledge in poetry/experimental work. It will also look at the way’s writers work to find creativity and ideas, and habits they use to enhance their practice.</p>
<p><strong>Researching as a Writer 2: Practising Ideas, Articulating Practice</strong></p>
<p>The second six-week research module tackles how students approach the challenge of writing creatively about their practice in ways that stretch the standard academic ‘analytical’ writing and yet encourage them to understand and articulate the research issues and questions that underpin specific projects, and their emerging sense of their wider writing practice (and its thematic concerns). It gives students the opportunity to situate their writing, and thinking, amongst contemporary issues and ideas. These concerns may range across considerations of creativity, play, knowledge, gender, identity, sexuality, class, and the relationship between aesthetics and politics. Students explore alternative traditions of articulating practice from the manifesto to the experimental essay and the rich heritage of ‘poetics’ as a speculative hybrid discourse, a mid-point between ‘theory’ and ‘practice’. The module builds upon the Benchmark Statement’s commitment to ‘Creative Writing as an academic pursuit [that] develops a range of cognitive abilities related to the aesthetic, ethical and social contexts of human experience.’ As such, it fosters ‘the ability to see the world from different perspectives, both as a life skill and as an essential part of artistic practice’ (QAA 6). The ability to conceptualise their practice in relation to research questions and contributions to knowledge is a crucial M level skill that will assist them in their professional development, for example in funding applications, and PhD work.</p>
<p><strong>Developing Writing 1: Craft, Form and Exploratory Writing</strong></p>
<p>This 12-week module aims to develop your writing practice and craft skills in relation to your chosen research project and its genre(s). It will also encourage experimentation with writing, both in terms of pushing your current practice in new directions, and in trying new forms and ideas. Half of the module will be devoted to issues of craft, form and genre; and half will be devoted to ‘exploratory’ writing as ways of developing both your general sense of craft, and the specific project you want to select as the main focus of this 12-week block. <i>It is entirely up to you whether you continue with this project beyond these 12 weeks</i>. The first 6 weeks explore genre, craft and form, using in-situ tasks and a focus upon Weird Fiction as a hybrid genre that takes elements of horror, sci-fi and other forms and yet has developed a singular identity in recent years. The next 6 weeks of ‘exploratory writing’ encourages you to tackle aspects of your chosen research project from productively ‘slanted’ angles. As such, we will adopt Fernando Pessoa’s practice of ‘heteronymity’ to self-multiply into different writing identities with discrete writerly concerns and styles. Each week we will frame the session by looking at one of the 6 ‘values, qualities, or peculiarities of literature’ that Italo Calvino regards as aspects of creative practice that ‘only literature can give us.’</p>
<p><strong>Developing Writing 2: Genre Case Study </strong></p>
<p>This 12-week module is divided into two halves that put into practice an understanding of the various functions and significance of genre, by enabling the students to experience 6 different genres and the craft challenges specific to them. The first six weeks are devoted to weekly specialist sessions wherein a practitioner, expert in a given genre, will lead a session on their experience of working within it, in terms of crafts techniques and market considerations for a professional context. It is understood that the genre the student ultimately selects, must be different from the project they are pursuing for the CREW 5012 module. Sessions may include genres and forms as various as TV Sitcom, Speculative Fiction, Working-Class fiction, Memoir writing, Crime fiction and the poetry sequence. After these 6 weeks, the students select the genre they want to explore; and each following weekly workshop will be led by several students responsible for bringing in an excerpt from their work in this form, an example of published work in this form, and craft challenges and tips for discussion.</p>
<p><strong>The Writing Ecosystem</strong><strong> 1: Navigating networks </strong></p>
<p>This module will focus on markets for creative writing in terms of routes into publishing and the production of written work. It will also investigate ecosystems that provide work, professional development and support for writers. We will look at submitting work for publication, applying for grants, writing as a business and the publishing/production industries. We will also explore the avenue of producing your own work independently, both in terms of self-publishing and indie filmmaking via crowdfunding etc. The module will reinforce the importance of collaboration and explore the significance of the ‘Author’s Story.’</p>
<p><strong>The Writing Ecosystem 2: Performance, Presentation, Pedagogy</strong></p>
<p>This module is the second ‘Ecosystems’ module that faces outwards towards employability broadly conceived as equipping you with skills for a range of career contexts, as well as a sound understanding of Creative Writing as a discipline. In the current professional landscape, it’s imperative that writers are able to present themselves and their work, as being involved in events and elements of self-promotion are a necessity. Doing so is predicated upon developing an understanding of what Creative Writing ‘is,’ and the different purposes and audiences (or, ‘ecosystems’ it might serve). Addressing different aspects of Creative Writing pedagogy, and ‘creativity,’ will allow you to simultaneously develop new knowledge about how we learn, and be able to articulate the transferable skills that your subject embodies. We will focus upon the applicability of such knowledge: both how you might personally use it to present your work to an audience, and how you might develop teaching materials to use in future workshops of your own. The aim is to increase your ability to confidently present your work, and articulate your processes and practice for a variety of audiences; formal interviews, post-reading Q+A, running workshops or teaching creative writing as part of a portfolio career. How do you select and present materials to read in public? How would you run a workshop; what would you focus upon, and what teaching methods would you use? These are just some of the questions that will preoccupy us.</p>
<p><strong>Final Dissertation<i> </i></strong></p>
<p>The final dissertation module is an extended creative project of your choice—for example a collection of poems or short stories, a novel extract, a creative non-fiction piece, or an experimental cross-platform/genre piece. The dissertation module will be supported by a critical or reflective commentary. Total word count is between 15-25,000 words, including a 2000-word reflective commentary, and a project synopsis. The project may well be exactly the work you have been planning since the early modules on the programme, or it may be something that has developed more recently, stimulated by other work encountered: the choice is yours. You will be divided into peer ‘response groups’ for further support.</p>

<h4><strong>Researcher Development, Review and Assessment</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Training Needs Analysis</strong><br>During the probationary period, you will carry out a Training Needs Analysis (TNA) in order to personalise the range of skills development in research required for your project . You will complete this within three months of enrolment for full-time students and six months for part-time students. A range of compulsory and optional courses from the Researcher Development Programme form the basis of the TNA, which can be supplemented according to your specific needs (eg in languages, technical skills, etc). The TNA is submitted online with the support of your supervisor.</p>
<p><strong>Formal Review</strong><br>All research students registered on the Doctoral Researcher Programme carry out a Formal Review to confirm PhD as their award aim (This does not apply if you are studying for the MA/MSc by Research or if you are aiming for an MPhil). The Formal Review submission includes a detailed review of literature relevant to your topic along with discussion of your proposed research methods and work you have undertaken to that point—such as data collection and/or analysis, as well as your plans for the work required to complete your project. Students completing practice-based PhDs (for example where artistic creation is part of the research methodology) will also submit examples of practical work completed to that point.</p>
<p><strong>Annual Review</strong><br>A formal Annual Review Panel is held to discuss in detail your proposed research objectives for the following year and the research project achievements of the previous year.</p>
<p><strong>Progress Reports</strong><br>Online progress reports are required at least once a month. As a research student you are required to discuss your work regularly with your supervisors as an essential part of the teaching and learning contract between you and the University. These Progress Reports are an important record of the interactions you have with your supervisors and really help keep your work on track to successful completion.</p>
<h4>Completion Period</h4>
<p><strong>Thesis Submission</strong><br>The submission of your thesis for examination is be accompanied by a thesis submission form which confirms the originality of the work. You will complete this form when your thesis is submitted to the Graduate School Office (GSO).</p>
<p><strong>The Viva Voce Examination</strong><br>All research degree students undergo an oral examination, the ‘viva voce’, which takes place after you have submitted your thesis to the GSO. The examination team consists of at least two academics with significant expertise in your field. Normally there will be one internal examiner (a member of staff of the University) and an external examiner who is chosen for their particular experience and academic status.. Your first supervisor will take responsibility for arranging the viva voce examination once the nominated examiners have been approved by your Faculty and the Director of Graduate School.</p>
<p><strong>Contact Hours</strong><br>Full-time research degree students are expected to undertake at least 35 hours a week of study throughout the year. Part-time students are expected to undertake 12 hours per week. This will include meeting regularly with your supervisor, as set out in the Code of Practice for Research Degree Students.</p>

</div>","One of the major changes envisaged in the Five Year view and further developed in the 10 year Plan was the changing roles of Nurses, Midwives and Allied health professionals, essentially taking on roles that previously were the domain of medical staff. This has of course been happening for many years but numbers have increased significantly over recent times and with it a burgeoning desire to see standards set and the role clearly defined.,There is unfortunately still no clear definition of what ‘advanced practice’ is and therefore the education and roles that the practitioner might be required to perform or undertake is also open to question. There is however clear support from all parties involved (across the UK) that the educational provision should be at Masters level; and ideally a full MSc. The Department of Health (DoH) and HEE have published curriculum guidelines pertaining to the content of ACP courses in an attempt to introduce some standardisation. The full MSc enhances the practitioner’s ability to appraise research, think critically, and prepares them to develop further beyond simply the role of an expert clinician.","<div>

<p>Students must complete a total of 180 credits.</p>
<p><strong>Year one</strong></p>
<h4>MPHE 5801 – Advanced Consultation and physical examination skills</h4>
<p>This is the physical examination / history-taking module and will enable the student to critically appraise the underlying principles of consultation and physical examination. It is assessed with an assignment and OSCE’s. Runs in Semester 1. Allied issues such as requesting investigations, inter-professional team working, patient referral mechanisms and professional accountability in an advanced role are also addressed. It is aimed at those health care practitioners who will be professionally supported in this active interventionist role.  It is relevant to Registered Paramedics, Nurses and Allied Health Professionals working within a variety of primary and secondary care settings.</p>
<p>If you do not work in an environment where you will have the opportunity to see / examine all systems, then you will need to be able to take time to access such an environment.</p>
<h4>MPHE 5804 – Diagnostic Reasoning for Advanced Clinical Practice</h4>
<p>The module will enable the student to make informed judgements, problem solve and identify complex health needs and issues specific to an advanced clinical role. It covers pathophysiology, diagnostic reasoning and the application of specialist knowledge (e.g. rheumatology, haematology, hepatology) to general ACP practice. It runs in Semester 2 and is assessed with a portfolio and case study.</p>
<h4>MPHE 5204 – Independent Study – Advanced Practice</h4>
<p>This Semester 1 module allows you to develop and explore in depth an area of developing and/or developed health and professional practice. In negotiation with your manager or module leader, an area of new or continuing developed study will be identified.</p>
<p>Building on prior achievements concerning your knowledge and experience you will take forward an area of developing health and professional practice using the framework of independent contracted learning</p>
<p>This is an independent study module and you will be required to negotiate individual tutorials with the relevant supervisor/s to discuss the learning outcomes of the module. The content for this module will be influenced by your choice of topic to study. You will be required to critically examine a topic independently.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the module will provide the opportunity to critically examine an issue which is relevant to your current practice. Critical analysis of professional practice is also encouraged using a national and international perspective.</p>
