								<h4>Modules</h4>
<p><strong>Compulsory modules:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Research Investigation (40 credits): </strong>The aim of this module is to facilitate and express independent enquiry in a substantial piece of individual self-directed research work. This module provides students with the opportunity to plan and conduct a piece of research through individual and independent activity and to present their findings in using visual aids and in written academic format that meets professional standards. Students will develop research objectives, formulate appropriate methodologies, and apply problem solving and analytical skills in a business context of their choice. You will be able to choose between a traditional dissertation, an organisation-based project, a business research project and a business creation project.</p>
<p>Students have the opportunity to complete the investigation in the form of:</p>
<ul>
<li data-gc-list-depth=""1"" data-gc-list-style=""bullet"">Traditional dissertation</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth=""1"" data-gc-list-style=""bullet"">Research report</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth=""1"" data-gc-list-style=""bullet"">Consultancy project</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth=""1"" data-gc-list-style=""bullet"">Business creation project</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Operations and Project Management: </strong>This module seeks to develop an appreciation of the theoretical and practical issues relating to project management and operations management from a strategic and operations perspective. Students will develop a broad and critically understanding of the different aspects of organisations operations and the relationships between the various operational areas.<em> </em></p>
<p><strong>Developing Organisational Strategy in the Digital World: </strong>The requirement for effective strategic management is increasing due to the highly complex and turbulent environments in which most private and public sector organisations currently exist. The study of organisational strategy encompasses theory and practice from a broad range of business sectors. As such, this module draws on concepts introduced in earlier modules and furthers the critical understanding of these topics and their inter-relationships. The module examines theories and models used in strategic management and decision making and reviews existing practice. </p>
<p><strong>Strategic Leadership for Innovation and Change: </strong>This module provides students with a detailed understanding of the key concepts and principles of leadership and how leadership may be used to influence innovation and change within organisations. It considers leadership as a fundamental and pivotal role within organisational development and in particular how the behaviour of a leader influences both individual and organisational performance and creativity. The module also seeks to identify how leaders may interact with individuals to raise their performance.</p>
<p><strong>Optional modules:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Business Ethics and Corporate Social Responsibility: </strong>It is important to integrate questions of business ethics &amp; CSR with broader concerns around corporate citizenship, globalisation and sustainability. Therefore, there is value in bringing together diverse perspectives in order to offer a comprehensive and holistic account of contemporary business ethics &amp; CSR. Furthermore, this module aligns well with the mission of the PRME (Principles for Responsible Management Education) initiative to inspire and champion responsible management education.</p>
<p>This module will provide students with a critical understanding of business ethics &amp; CSR and enable them to apply these concepts to the corporations’ major stakeholders. It seeks to encourage students to draw upon concepts and principles so that they can critically explore issues associated with the ethical challenges facing organisations that cross different functions in a fast-changing global business environment.</p>
<p><strong>Technological Issues in a Digital Era: </strong>Advances in IT have transformed the way in which people live, work, learn, communicate and conduct business. This module examines the issues arising from advances in IT, and the responsibility that business managers and technical developers have with regards to computer use. The module will serve to increase the understanding of issues related to ethics, professional conduct and social responsibility as they arise in the field of IT. The module provides students with an opportunity to develop skills of analysis and problem solving, enabling students to develop a critical awareness of responsible IT use. This enables them to deal with the problems, choices and constraints involved in the development of effective and sustainable strategies.</p>
<p><strong>Dissecting Work and Organisational Psychology: </strong>This module explores different psychological theories and their application in organisational settings. The module will enable you to develop your appreciation of the psychological study of work organisations and work behaviour in a contemporary business context. You will explore the application of contemporary work and organisational psychology to business issues and functions. Key subjects covered during the module include psychological assessment at work; learning, training and development; leadership, engagement and motivation; well-being and work; organisational design, change and development; and applying work and organisational psychology.</p>

<p><strong>Media modules include:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Writing the Media<br></strong>This module encourages you to explore and critically engage with a range of contemporary media debates and communications. The module is both exploratory and practical, using a range of current sources, structured exercises, hand-outs and discussion. Drawing upon this material you will explore media issues in relation to persuasion, tone of voice and dialogue. In doing so, you will analyse the ways in which media texts and images operate and start to question what they can learn from them. Through the investigation of these topics you will consider their own cultural practices and how they construct a sense of identity and give rise to certain meanings.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Perspectives<br></strong>The module aims to introduce the understanding that differing critical perspectives are possible in the consideration and analysis of any given media text or texts. You will explore the subject of ideology through the viewing practices and belief structures of media audiences. Through the study of media communication models and their history, and through engagement with the extensive body of media audience literature (primarily but certainly not exclusively relating to television audiences), you will explore the nature of contemporary mass communication. </p>
<p><strong>Media Research<br></strong>This module introduces you to experiences in higher education. It uses a variety of methods to engage you and to develop their your in research, referencing, critical thinking, academic writing, presentation skills and group work.  Relevant examples of contemporary topics, themes and images will also be used to illustrate the importance of analysing the media. Overall this module provides a range of skills that will be essential to producing successful work as an undergraduate. A key element will be to encourage the idea that studying is fun as well as hard work. </p>
<p><strong>Media, Culture and Society<br></strong>This module aims to explore theories and concepts associated with analytical readings of the media. You will examine a variety of ‘texts’ to exemplify essential theoretical perspectives and will introduce key issues and debates relating to Media in social and cultural contexts.

The module will provide opportunities for you to assess and evaluate key modes of critical and analytical investigation. </p>
<p><strong>The Medium is the Message – Media Evolution and History<br></strong>The module will introduce you to the area of study known as ‘media ecology’ which encourages an understanding of a medium as anything in which meaning or communication of any sort talks place. Key thinkers in this field are most importantly Marshall McLuhan, Neil Postman, and Walter Ong amongst a number of others. The module will provide an introduction to the deep history of media and allied technologies (writing, printing, painting) and will examine how media, in the broadest of senses, determine the possibilities of communication, creative activity and understanding.</p>

<p><strong>Adaptations (20 credits)<br></strong>We look at the different ways books and films tell stories, and what happens to literature and literary characters when they get ‘translated’ onto the screen. In addition to examining specific examples of film adaptation, students can choose to experiment creatively on a project of their own.</p>
<p><strong>Science Fiction for Survival (20 credits)<br></strong>Drawing on a range of theoretical and critical concepts around utopianism, the module will consider landmarks in the history of Science Fiction in order to develop students’ understanding of key concerns relevant to the genre. The title ‘Science Fiction for Survival’ aims to highlight the way in which science fiction, through its attention to both technology and ideology, encourages readers/viewers to consider the way in which humanity’s post-industrial choices have impacted directly on the well-being of the planet and its diverse human and non-human inhabitants.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Media Modules include:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Convergence Cultures<br></strong>This module will introduce students to the theory and practice of convergence technology and with associated areas of transmedia activity and network theory.

<p><strong>Issues of Taste<br></strong>This module aims to engage students in debates about the production, reception and contexts of media and cultural products which have produced controversy. It aims to analyse the debates about taste and the reception of text in a range of traditional, new and emergent media and to conduct this analysis using terms from aesthetics, from studies in contemporary media, and from the writings and records of those involved in critical debate and rereading. It will include concepts such as:  propaganda, artistic licence, canonical status, acceptability, pornography, ‘harm’, censorship, etc. </p>

You will be able to understand the essential relationships between word and image from illustration to the internet. The module will investigate how visual strategies can be used to communicate complex ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Globalisation<br></strong>‘Globalisation’ is a fundamentally important term in understanding the processes of cultural, political and social change in the modern world. The role of the media in reacting to these processes through representation and articulation, and also in contributing to these changes, is inescapable. The aims of this module are to introduce you to the key theoretical debates and ideas which surround the contested notion of ‘globalisation’ and to examine the ways in which globalisation has been articulated and understood through media representation. The module will also examine the role of the media in reflecting and reacting to the processes of globalisation and its role in affecting emergent, resistant and dominant cultures.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Media Enterprise<br></strong>The module examines some of the different processes required to produce a professional portfolio in the context of practical and vocational activities. The module aims to offer you the opportunity to engage with a more vocational element in the media and cultural context of their degree.

							<p>English Literature is a rich and vibrant area of study. At YSJU, we are a dynamic, engaged, and research-active team who are committed to providing our students with a cutting-edge education. By studying English Literature, you will have the opportunity to learn about a range of different genres, historical periods, and literary forms. In English Literature, our philosophy is simple: <em>words matter</em>. Words shape the world we live in (books can and have changed the world) and the connections between the written page and the concerns of the ‘real’ world are a crucial part of the programme. Overall, the degree will enable you to develop your expertise as a reader and critic of a range of literary materials, whilst also supporting you in the development of a portfolio of professional skills which will aid you in the wider job market. As you become adept at independent learning, you will become a more sophisticated reader of texts, and you will find that your confidence as a writer and as a critic will increase as your degree progresses.   </p>
<p>The Creative Writing side of your degree will enable you to develop work in a variety of forms and genres, from penning your own poetry, fiction and scripts, to exploring creative non-fiction and other experimental modes of writing. You will be taught by our team of award-winning, published writers and academics, and you’ll have the opportunity to attend workshops and readings from a range of internationally-acclaimed visiting writers. You’ll learn to read and analyse texts in order to help you develop your own work, and you’ll also have the chance to get involved in events, performances and publications. This is a dynamic, challenging and creative course, which will provide you with a range of transferable skills.</p>

							<h3 class=""h-border"">Level 1</h3>
<p>The programme is specifically designed so that you will have a foundational Level 1 year that introduces you to the skills required for University-level Literature and Creative Writing studies. All our introductory Literature modules seek to equip students with an understanding of historical developments in the form of the written word. These modules provide you with a basic grounding in key texts, major historical moments, and important critical terms that will be applicable across the rest of your Degree.</p>

							<h4>Modules</h4>
<p><strong>Modules include:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction to Literary Studies I (20 credits) <br></strong>In this module you will have the chance to build your confidence in working with literature at degree level. You will engage with a range of texts written prior to the nineteenth century that includes prose, drama, poetry, speeches, letters and articles. Together, we will start to think about some of the ways that literature and history can be brought together and why the study of English Literature remains a popular and important discipline.</p>
<p><strong>Writing, Research and Literature (20 credits) <br></strong>On this module you will learn the basics of academic writing and research at University level. Drawing upon a range of classic and contemporary short stories and poems as your starting point, you will develop a range of skills such as, using the library catalogue, choosing secondary sources, planning essays, developing arguments, and close reading texts, so that you can write and discuss the works that inspire you with confidence and flair.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction to Literary Studies II (20 credits) <br></strong>On this module we’ll examine some well-known classics alongside more unusual selections that help us to question the social, political, cultural and historical values by which we approach literature. This includes an exciting range of texts across different media and forms, from nineteenth century poetry to early cinema and 1930s nonfiction. Along the way we’ll be thinking about gender, class, war, empire, form, genre, and much more besides.</p>
<p><strong>Theorising Literature: Power and Identity (20 credits) <br></strong>The critic Michel Foucault once wrote that ‘power is everywhere’; on this module we seek to uncover the ways that economic, social, and cultural power is portrayed and exerted through the written word. Who has the power in a literary text? And how do we as readers discern this? We will discuss these issues as they relate to identity politics and the intersections between class, gender, race, sexuality, ability, nation, and age in selected literary works.</p>
<p><strong>Canonicity (20 credits) <br></strong>This module prepares students to reflect on the study of Literature at Undergraduate level by introducing them to two key, overarching concepts: the idea of literary value and the canon. The module is designed to complement semester 1 modules in which issues of literary value and the canon are raised, albeit in less detail, and to provide a meta-context for students to learn and reflect on <em>why</em> they study <em>what</em> they study at university as well as, more precisely, how canonical assumptions can influence their reading and writing.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction to Creative Writing (20 credits) <br></strong>This module is designed to introduce you to good writing practices and to familiarise you with sharing your work in progress in a workshop environment – which will be a major part of your degree programme. You will be introduced to a variety of strategies and techniques for starting to write.</p>
<p><strong>Forms of Narrative (20 credits) <br></strong>Good writers are good readers first and foremost. This module aims to introduce you to theories, debates, and practices in narrative, in order to enhance your understanding of narrative as it functions within literature and culture generally. You’ll explore films, novels, poetry, plays, graphic novels, and other experimental forms of narrative. There is a choice of creative or critical assessments.</p>
<p><strong>Writing to Order (20 credits) <br></strong>This module is intended to introduce you to a range of professional contexts and practices for creative writing. Previous guest speakers have included successful novelists, poets, scriptwriters and researchers, who have shared their professional experiences with students. The module gives you the opportunity to experiment with a range of written forms, as well as sharing your work in progress and learning more about how professional writers work.</p>
<p><strong>Creative Research for Creative Writing (20 credits) <br></strong>This module introduces you to important approaches for researching and inspiring your creative work. You’ll explore different research methods, from using archives to working with real-life experiences and collaborating with experts and artists in different media.</p>

								<h3 class=""h-border"">Level 2</h3>
<p>At Level 2 you have the chance to follow your own writing and research interests, and select the modules that most appeal to you. As a joint honours student, you will take an employability module with either English Literature or Creative Writing. Both of these modules encourage students to consider their professional and transferable skills, and how they might utilise them in the working world, as well as allowing students to undertake work-related projects and have the opportunity to meet professionals from industries including publishing, journalism, and teaching. This innovative approach to employability has been extremely popular with our students over the past few years.</p>

							</div>
							<div class=""col"">

								<h4>Modules</h4>
<p><strong>Modules include:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Literary Theory<br></strong>Is it proper to remove literary texts from their historical contexts, or is historical awareness essential to any understanding of the text? Is it really the case that a text can mean anything to anybody, or are there more objective ways of understanding what texts are and how they work? What is actually happening when we read literature? And what is ‘literature’ anyway? This module will engage with the fundamental questions lying behind the discipline of literary studies. Through a direct discussion of theoretical texts, it will examine concepts such as beauty, culture and language from a range of perspectives.</p>
<p><strong>Mapping America<br></strong>This module introduces students to the relationship between American literature and physical and mythical/symbolic spaces, and explores the ways in which this space is imagined and represented in a range of texts. The rationale behind this module is to ask students to think creatively, critically, and innovatively about physical space and literature, and explore the relationship between American socio-economic history, and the development of a specifically American literary tradition.</p>
<p><strong>Science Fiction for Survival<br></strong>Drawing on a range of theoretical and critical concepts around utopianism, the module will consider landmarks in the history of Science Fiction in order to develop students’ understanding of key concerns relevant to the genre. The title ‘Science Fiction for Survival’ aims to highlight the way in which science fiction, through its attention to both technology and ideology, encourages readers/viewers to consider the way in which humanity’s post-industrial choices have impacted directly on the well-being of the planet and its diverse human and non-human inhabitants. Students on the module will have the opportunity to get involved with the project <a href=""https://yorkstjohnterratwo.com/"">Terra Two: An Ark for Off-World Survival</a>, and to develop content for the site.  </p>
<p><strong>Conflicting Words<br></strong>This module provides an opportunity to read texts produced by and written about major conflicts of the twentieth and early twenty first centuries. We will start with the mechanised horror of the Western Front and work our way through the Second World War, the Spanish Civil War, Vietnam, the Troubles, 9/11 and the War on Terror. We read texts by writers as diverse as Martha Gellhorn, George Orwell and Kurt Vonnegut and examine the complex relationship between language, experience and memory.</p>
<p><strong>Sick Novels: Literature and Disease<br></strong>On this module we’ll be looking at the ways in which diseases are represented in novels from several different periods. What sorts of things can disease suggest in the literary text, and what kinds of associations come with different diseases? Why do some diseases seem to appear in many novels (tuberculosis and cancer, for example) and why are some less often written about? What kinds of anxieties about society do diseases embody or allow the author to explore?</p>
<p><strong>Shakespeare: Perspectives<br></strong>This is an exciting module which will explore Shakespeare’s plays in their early modern contexts but also understand them as written for performance. We will also explore them as modern/post-modern texts in reception. The module engages with a range of theoretical approaches, from new historicist to feminist and queer readings.</p>
<p><strong>From Harlem to Hip-Hop: African American Literature and Culture<br></strong>Obama...Beyoncé...the 'Black Lives Matter' movement. Without doubt, the African American experience is a major influence on our contemporary political, cultural, and social landscape. Starting with the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s and continuing through to the present day, we will discuss key African American novels, plays, and poems alongside music (including jazz, soul, blues, and hip-hop), film, art, and political writings in order to better understand the ways that black writers respond to and shape American culture and history.</p>
<p><strong>Civil War to Civil Society: British Literature, 1640-1740<br></strong>The English Civil War and execution of Charles I, the Commonwealth, the ‘Glorious Revolution’, and the Restoration of the Crown led to a period of great literary production – as well as suspicion from those in power towards writers and publishers. This module will engage with the ways in which literature challenged and negotiated what it meant to be ‘civil’ in the 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> centuries. How did writers explain seismic changes to a growing readership? How did new voices (the working class, women, writers of colour, dissenting writers) enter the conversation? What new <em>kinds</em> of literature emerged to make sense of events and what kind of community was created through reading?</p>
<p><strong>Adaptations<br></strong>We look at the different ways books and films tell stories, and what happens to literature and literary characters when they get ‘translated’ onto the screen. In addition to examining specific examples of film adaptation, students can choose to experiment creatively on a project of their own.</p>
<p><strong>Literature at Work<br></strong>This module will enable English Literature students to engage in discussions about a range of career trajectories relevant to their degree on both a practical and ideological level. Crucially, the module will facilitate reflective thinking about skillsets and their relationship to students’ career aims.  Team work and project management are integral features, with students working in groups to develop, plan, and execute a project or alternatively, to engage in work-place learning through an external placement. Guest speakers will introduce a variety of graduate career pathways, potentially including publishing, research, teaching, marketing, and journalism.</p>
<p><strong>Revolution and Response: British Literature, 1740-1840<br></strong>Beginning with the ‘rise of sensibility’, this module will explore the idea of ‘revolution’ and the myriad ways in which the literature published in these decades agitated for and responded to political upheavals and changes as well as ‘revolutions’ in literary tastes and production, gender roles and expectations, the role of literature, and the relationship between individuals and society.</p>
<p><strong>Writing Fiction<br></strong>An opportunity to read and produce a range of fictional forms, from flash-fictions to novellas, short stories to novels. You will develop an understanding of characterisation; voice; plotting; narration; dialogue and point of view. By the end of the course, you’ll have written your own fiction portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>Writing Reality: Creative Non-Fiction<br></strong>You will have the opportunity to explore examples of non-fiction such as journalism, creative non-fiction, fictocriticism, manifestos, political tracts, graffiti, non-fiction graphic novels, blogs, online journals, live-tweeting and new media, travel writing, documentary and life writing. By viewing, reading and watching a range of non-fictional texts, you will develop your own original non-fictional texts.</p>
<p><strong>Writing Poetry<br></strong>From the sonnet to the prose poem, learn about the formal qualities of poetry, how to produce dazzling imagery and perfect rhythm; manipulate voice and pace. You will study a range of contemporary poets, supplemented by visits and readings from some of them. You will produce your own portfolio of pieces by the end of the course.</p>
<p><strong>Scriptwriting<br></strong>This module addresses the essential elements of scriptwriting – writing convincing dialogue, creating interesting characters, and constructing coherent stories – within a creative and supportive atmosphere. You will develop your expressive and technical skills in writing scripts for one or more of the following disciplines: radio, television, stage and film, culminating in the creation of your own original script.</p>
<p><strong>Working with Words: Publishing and Performance<br></strong>The aim of this work-related module is to develop your understanding of the relationship between creative writing practices and employability in the creative industries, by offering you the opportunity to explore and engage with methods and means of literary publishing, production, and performance.</p>

<p>In your final year you will be ready to take on a bigger role in the management of your learning. You might find yourself leading a class discussion, or doing a non-assessed presentation in a seminar. You will write a dissertation (an extended project that runs for the whole academic year) on the subject of your choice, and with the support of an academic supervisor. In many ways, this is in the intellectual culmination of your degree, as you become an independent researcher and are required to manage your own academic project. Many of our students note that this is one of the most enjoyable sections of their degree, as they are specialising in a literary topic that they are passionate about, and are putting into practice the skills they have accrued during their time at York St John University.</p>

Students write a dissertation (an extended project that runs for the whole academic year) on the subject of their choice, and with the support of an academic supervisor. In many ways, this is in the intellectual culmination of the degree, as students become independent researchers and are required to manage their own academic project. Many of our students note that this is one of the most enjoyable sections of their degree, as they are specialising in a literary topic that they are passionate about, and are putting into practice the skills they have accrued during their time at York St John.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Creative Writing </strong><strong>Dissertation<br></strong>In your final year, you have the opportunity to devise your own original creative writing project. You’ll write a dissertation (an extended piece of writing), in a form of your own choosing with the support of an individual supervisor. This is the creative and intellectual culmination of your degree, and provides the opportunity to focus on researching and developing a piece of work that particularly excites you. Many students find this to be one of the most rewarding experiences of their degree.</p>
<p><strong>The Victorian Novel: Realism, Sensation, </strong><strong>Naturalism<br></strong>On this module we’ll focus on the ways in which the novel as a form was developed, challenged, and experimented with in the Victorian period. We’ll consider how the novel engages with and represents social issues in the period, but we’ll also look at the ways in which the novel form itself adapted and transformed as a vehicle of expression: from realist texts which set out to depict believable and probable events and characters, to science fiction, the sensation novel, romance, mystery, and adventure.</p>
<p><strong>The Experimental Century<br></strong>By the beginning of the twentieth century, many of the religious, philosophical and cultural assumptions of the Western hemisphere had been smashed into pieces. In this pessimistic moment flourished a range of aesthetic movements whose radical call was to ‘make it new’. This module will introduce students to these restless modernists, and explore the consequences of their work in twentieth century culture. Along the way it will examine how the Civil Rights Movement, feminism, and queer subcultures turned experimental aesthetics to new, politically radical ends. </p>
<p><strong>Gothic Origins<br></strong>‘The Gothic’, according to David Punter, ‘arises on the sites of vanished cultural territories’ (2000). The point of ‘vanishing’ conceals and reveals the origin of this ‘contested, maligned, and misunderstood’ (Carol M. Davison, 2009) mode of writing. This module will provide an opportunity for students to engage with the ‘origins’ of Gothic literature and conventions, exploring the ways in which the Gothic persists and adapts to different historical and cultural contexts. We will be reading poetry and prose, drama and non-fiction throughout the module, as well as considering other media (art, film, sound) and critical theories of the Gothic. </p>
<p><strong>The Making of Modern Drama<br></strong>This module examines aspects of theatrical experimentation over the last century, and its impact on the contemporary stage. In addition to comparing the aims and achievements of different theatrical movements, students may undertake a creative project (e.g. writing a script or designing a stage-production) in response to what they have learned. </p>
<p><strong>Research Now I and II<br></strong>This module recognizes the interest students have in the research culture and open environment that we have cultivated at YSJU. This allows final year students to respond to current and ongoing research projects within the lecturing team, building on their research skills and supporting the specific skills demanded of final-year work and dissertation modules.</p>
<p><strong>American Radicals: Outside the Canon<br></strong>This module will examine a selection of texts from twentieth century American literature and relate the works to their cultural, social and political backgrounds. The module will focus on texts that demonstrate formal innovation and experimentation, and will reflect the plurality of twentieth century American experience. Students might read Native American, African American, Chicana, Chinese-American texts alongside literature produced in the wake of radical social change such as Beat writing, Vietnam narratives, and responses to 9/11. </p>
<p><strong>Writing the Caribbean<br></strong>This module will examine a range of texts from the Anglophone and Anglocreole Caribbean, a region that has produced two Nobel Prize winners in Literature (Derek Walcott &amp; V.S. Naipaul). The aim is to introduce students to a range of writing from and about the Caribbean which reveal the longstanding global dimensions of this writing and the ways in which this is currently being marked and remembered. The close connections between Britain and the Caribbean will be a particular focus, both in a historical and contemporary context.</p>
<p><strong>Gender and Sexualities<br></strong>When it comes to issues of gender and sexuality, what is natural and what is cultural? How have gender debates informed popular culture and critical theory? How are different genders and sexualities presented in film and literature? And how do different cultural groups use popular culture and literature to reinforce, challenge, transgress or disrupt traditional gender expectations? Coming in the final semester of third year, this module challenges students to draw on all of the skills, theories and approaches they have rehearsed throughout the degree to confront, explore and interrogate the representation of gender roles and sexuality in popular culture.</p>
<p><strong>Writing Genres<br></strong>You will be encouraged to consider the historical, theoretical, cultural and political dimensions of genre, alongside developing knowledge of the conventions of specific genres. You will also be given the opportunity to critically explore differentiations between “high” and “low” culture. You will develop your understanding of the emergence of genres such as tragedy, satire and gothic, and the conventions of contemporary genres such as romance, horror, and noir.</p>
<p><strong>Contemporary Writing 1: Innovation and Experimentation<br></strong>This module provides the opportunity to study and develop creative work at the cutting-edge. You’ll look at writing that challenges the traditional boundaries of literature and is fresh, exciting and innovative. You’ll consider a broad range of materials and techniques that will help you to develop your own innovative creative practices.</p>
<p><strong>Contemporary Writing 2: Literary and Publishing Culture Now<br></strong>This module introduces a range of very contemporary publishing and literary cultures, with a view to helping you position your own work in the contemporary literary landscape. It also has a practical focus, and will help you to develop a professional portfolio that can be sued as a springboard after your degree course.</p>

							<p>Film is beneficial as mode of engagement and inquiry in relation to literary texts, and literature can help film specialists to analyse different forms of text and adaptation. You might find yourself referring to film sources as part of your literary studies, as well as reading literary texts as a way of developing your understanding of film and film history. Studied together, these subjects allow students to gain a detailed understanding of communication in all its forms, from historical sources and documents, to contemporary literary texts, documentaries, and film adaptations.</p>

							

						</div>
						<div class=""col"">

							<p>The programme is specifically designed so that you will have a foundational Level 1 year that introduces you to the skills required for University-level Literature and Film Studies. You will investigate the ways in which these two forms of storytelling have blended with one another for almost a century. This will include the study of the adaptation process which includes a range of literary forms such as the novel, plays and comic books. You will also consider the film industry and the ways in which historical fiction is used to make the British film industry a global presence and the ways in which cinematic universes (such as the Marvel universe) draw upon the traditions of the graphic novel which has recently dominated popular cinema. </p>
<p>All our introductory Literature modules seek to equip students with an understanding of historical developments in the form of the written word. These modules provide you with a basic grounding in key texts, major historical moments, and important critical terms that will be applicable across the rest of your degree. </p>

							<h4>Literature modules include: </h4>
<p><strong>Introduction to Literary Studies I (20 credits) </strong><strong><br></strong>In this module you will have the chance to build your confidence in working with literature at degree level. You will engage with a range of texts written prior to the nineteenth century that includes prose, drama, poetry, speeches, letters and articles. Together, we will start to think about some of the ways that literature and history can be brought together and why the study of English Literature remains a popular and important discipline.</p>
<p> <strong>Writing, Research and Literature (20 credits) </strong><strong><br></strong>On this module you will learn the basics of academic writing and research at University level. Drawing upon a range of classic and contemporary short stories and poems as your starting point, you will develop a range of skills such as, using the library catalogue, choosing secondary sources, planning essays, developing arguments, and close reading texts, so that you can write and discuss the works that inspire you with confidence and flair.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction to Literary Studies II (20 credits) </strong><strong><br></strong>On this module we’ll examine some well-known classics alongside more unusual selections that help us to question the social, political, cultural and historical values by which we approach literature. This includes an exciting range of texts across different media and forms, from nineteenth century poetry to early cinema and 1930s nonfiction. Along the way we’ll be thinking about gender, class, war, empire, form, genre, and much more besides.</p>
<p><strong>Theorising Literature: Power and Identity (20 credits) </strong><strong><br></strong>The critic Michel Foucault once wrote that ‘power is everywhere’; on this module we seek to uncover the ways that economic, social, and cultural power is portrayed and exerted through the written word. Who has the power in a literary text? And how do we as readers discern this? We will discuss these issues as they relate to identity politics and the intersections between class, gender, race, sexuality, ability, nation, and age in selected literary works.</p>
<p><strong>Canonicity (20 credits) </strong><strong><br></strong>This module prepares students to reflect on the study of Literature at undergraduate level by introducing them to two key, overarching concepts: the idea of literary value and the canon. The module is designed to complement semester 1 modules in which issues of literary value and the canon are raised, albeit in less detail, and to provide a meta-context for students to learn and reflect on <em>why</em> they study <em>what</em> they study at university as well as, more precisely, how canonical assumptions can influence their reading and writing. </p>
<h4>Film modules include: </h4>
<ul>
<li>Filmmakers on Film (20 credits) </li>
<li>Media Research (20 credits)</li>
<li>Film and its Audiences (20 credits)</li>

								<h4>Literature modules include:</h4>
<p><strong>Literary Theory (20 credits) </strong><strong><br></strong>Is it proper to remove literary texts from their historical contexts, or is historical awareness essential to any understanding of the text? Is it really the case that a text can mean anything to anybody, or are there more objective ways of understanding what texts are and how they work? What is actually happening when we read literature? And what is ‘literature’ anyway? This module will engage with the fundamental questions lying behind the discipline of literary studies. </p>
<p><strong>Mapping America (20 credits) </strong><strong><br></strong>This module introduces students to the relationship between American literature and physical and mythical/symbolic spaces, and explores the ways in which this space is imagined and represented in a range of texts. The rationale behind this module is to ask students to think creatively, critically, and innovatively about physical space and literature, and explore the relationship between American socio-economic history, and the development of a specifically American literary tradition.</p>
<p><strong>Conflicting Words (20 credits) </strong><strong><br></strong>This module provides an opportunity to read texts produced by and written about major conflicts of the twentieth and early twenty first centuries. We will start with the mechanised horror of the Western Front and work our way through the Second World War, the Spanish Civil War, Vietnam, the Troubles, 9/11 and the War on Terror. We read texts by writers as diverse as Martha Gellhorn, George Orwell and Kurt Vonnegut and examine the complex relationship between language, experience and memory.</p>
<p><strong>Sick Novels: Literature and Disease (20 credits) </strong><strong><br></strong>On this module we’ll be looking at the ways in which diseases are represented in novels from several different periods. What sorts of things can disease suggest in the literary text, and what kinds of associations come with different diseases? Why do some diseases seem to appear in many novels (tuberculosis and cancer, for example) and why are some less often written about? What kinds of anxieties about society do diseases embody or allow the author to explore?</p>
<p><strong>Shakespeare: Perspectives (20 credits) </strong><strong><br></strong>This is an exciting module which will explore Shakespeare’s plays in their early modern contexts but also understand them as written for performance. We will also explore them as modern/post-modern texts in reception. The module engages with a range of theoretical approaches, from new historicist to feminist and queer readings. </p>
<p><strong>From Harlem to Hip-Hop: African American Literature and Culture (20 credits) </strong><strong><br></strong>Without doubt, the African American experience is a major influence on our contemporary political, cultural, and social landscape. Starting with the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s and continuing through to the present day, we will discuss key African American novels, plays, and poems alongside music (including jazz, soul, blues, and hip-hop), film, art, and political writings in order to better understand the ways that black writers respond to and shape American culture and history.</p>
<p><strong>Civil War to Civil Society: British Literature, 1640-1740 (20 credits) </strong><strong><br></strong>The English Civil War and execution of Charles I, the Commonwealth, the ‘Glorious Revolution’, and the Restoration of the Crown led to a period of great literary production – as well as suspicion from those in power towards writers and publishers. This module will engage with the ways in which literature challenged and negotiated what it meant to be ‘civil’ in the 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup>centuries. </p>
<p><strong>Adaptations (20 credits) </strong><strong><br></strong>We look at the different ways books and films tell stories, and what happens to literature and literary characters when they get ‘translated’ onto the screen. In addition to examining specific examples of film adaptation, students can choose to experiment creatively on a project of their own.</p>
<p><strong>Literature at Work (20 credits) </strong><strong><br></strong>This module will enable English Literature students to engage in discussions about a range of career trajectories relevant to their degree on both a practical and ideological level. Crucially, the module will facilitate reflective thinking about skillsets and their relationship to students’ career aims. Team work and project management are integral features, with students working in groups to develop, plan, and execute a project or alternatively, to engage in work-place learning through an external placement. Guest speakers will introduce a variety of graduate career pathways, potentially including publishing, research, teaching, marketing, and journalism.</p>
<p><strong>Revolution and Response: British Literature, 1740-1840 (20 credits) </strong><strong><br></strong>Beginning with the ‘rise of sensibility’, this module will explore the idea of ‘revolution’ and the myriad ways in which the literature published in these decades agitated for and responded to political upheavals and changes as well as ‘revolutions’ in literary tastes and production, gender roles and expectations, the role of literature, and the relationship between individuals and society. This module will engage with the idea of ‘revolution’ through a wide range of topics and texts, including poetry, prose, and drama. </p>
<h4>Film modules include: </h4>

<li>Independent Cinema (20 credits)</li>
<li>Film and the American Imagination (20 credits)</li>
<li>Gothic and Horror (20 credits)</li>

<p>In your final year you will be ready to take on a bigger role in the management of your learning. You might find yourself leading a class discussion, or giving a non-assessed presentation in a seminar. You will write a dissertation (an extended project that runs for the whole academic year) on the subject of your choice, and with the support of an academic supervisor. In many ways, this is in the intellectual culmination of your degree, as you become an independent researcher and are required to manage your own academic project.

<p><strong>English Literature Dissertation (40 credits) </strong><strong><br></strong>In your final year, you will be ready to take on a bigger role in the management of your learning. Students write a dissertation (an extended project that runs for the whole academic year) on the subject of their choice, and with the support of an academic supervisor. In many ways, this is in the intellectual culmination of the degree, as students become independent researchers and are required to manage their own academic project. Many of our students note that this is one of the most enjoyable sections of their degree, as they are specialising in a literary topic that they are passionate about, and are putting into practice the skills they have accrued during their time at York St John.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Victorian Novel: Realism, Sensation, Naturalism (20 credits) </strong><strong><br></strong>On this module we’ll focus on the ways in which the novel as a form was developed, challenged, and experimented with in the Victorian period. We’ll consider how the novel engages with and represents social issues in the period, but we’ll also look at the ways in which the novel form itself adapted and transformed as a vehicle of expression: from realist texts which set out to depict believable and probable events and characters, to science fiction, the sensation novel, romance, mystery, and adventure.</p>
<p><strong>The Experimental Century (20 credits) </strong><strong><br></strong>By the beginning of the twentieth century, many of the religious, philosophical and cultural assumptions of the Western hemisphere had been smashed into pieces. In this pessimistic moment flourished a range of aesthetic movements whose radical call was to ‘make it new’. This module will introduce students to these restless modernists, and explore the consequences of their work in twentieth century culture. Along the way it will examine how the Civil Rights Movement, feminism, and queer subcultures turned experimental aesthetics to new, politically radical ends. </p>
<p><strong>Gothic Origins (20 credits) </strong><strong><br></strong>‘The Gothic’, according to David Punter, ‘arises on the sites of vanished cultural territories’ (2000). The point of ‘vanishing’ conceals and reveals the origin of this ‘contested, maligned, and misunderstood’ (Carol M. Davison, 2009) mode of writing. This module will provide an opportunity for students to engage with the ‘origins’ of Gothic literature and conventions, exploring the ways in which the Gothic persists and adapts to different historical and cultural contexts. We will be reading poetry and prose, drama and non-fiction throughout the module, as well as considering other media (art, film, sound) and critical theories of the Gothic. </p>
<p><strong>The Making of Modern Drama (20 credits) </strong><strong><br></strong>This module examines aspects of theatrical experimentation over the last century, and its impact on the contemporary stage. In addition to comparing the aims and achievements of different theatrical movements, students may undertake a creative project (e.g. writing a script or designing a stage-production) in response to what they have learned. </p>
<p><strong>Research Now I and II  (20 credits) </strong><strong><br></strong>This module recognizes the interest students have in the research culture and open environment that we have cultivated at YSJU. It allows final year students to respond to current and ongoing research projects within the lecturing team, building on their research skills and supporting the specific skills demanded of final-year work and dissertation modules.</p>
<p><strong>American Radicals: Outside the Canon (20 credits) </strong><strong><br></strong>This module will examine a selection of texts from twentieth century American literature and relate the works to their cultural, social and political backgrounds. The module will focus on texts that demonstrate formal innovation and experimentation, and will reflect the plurality of twentieth century American experience. Students might read Native American, African American, Chicana, Chinese-American texts alongside literature produced in the wake of radical social change such as Beat writing, Vietnam narratives, and responses to 9/11. </p>
<p><strong>Cultures of the Now: Contemporary Writing (20 credits) <br></strong>This module encourages students to consolidate their understanding of the history of literature by examining a range of texts from a variety of locations – Europe and the USA, but also Africa and the Asian subcontinent – in order to get a grip on the strange paradoxes of our own global moment. Is the world a fragmented assortment of local traditions, or a conformist monoculture? What do those in one part of the world owe to those living in another? And is the popularity of literary texts which seek to represent and understand ‘the other’ something to celebrate, or simply another manifestation of consumerism? </p>
<p><strong>Gender and Sexualities (20 credits) </strong><strong><br></strong>When it comes to issues of gender and sexuality, what is natural and what is cultural? How have gender debates informed popular culture and critical theory? And how do different cultural groups use popular culture and literature to reinforce, challenge, transgress or disrupt traditional gender expectations? Coming in the final semester of third year, this module challenges students to draw on all of the skills, theories and approaches they have rehearsed throughout the degree to confront, explore and interrogate the representation of gender roles and sexuality in popular culture. </p>

							<p><strong>Modules</strong></p>
<p><strong>Compulsory modules:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Practising Responsible Business Behaviours</strong></p>
<p>This module examines the nature of business enterprise and its relationship with wider society, seeking answers to the question: what does it mean for businesses to behave responsibly? There is an ongoing debate regarding this question, with answers ranging from ‘just maximize shareholder value’ to ‘consider everyone who is affected, including unborn future generations’, with many variations in between. In this ongoing debate, we encounter ideas regarding, for example, stakeholder theory, the triple bottom line, corporate social responsibility, business ethics, the role of the state or of supra-national organizations, and so on. This module aligns well with the mission of the PRME (Principles for Responsible Management Education) (PRME) initiative to inspire and champion responsible management education. The challenge in this module of applying ideas from a complex ongoing debate to contemporary business and societal issues will support students in the development of both academic and employability skills.</p>
<p><strong>Principles of Marketing</strong></p>
<p>The aim of this module is to provide students with the knowledge of the theory and operations related to marketing. The ability to recognise and meet customer needs is an important factor in the success of organisations, whether they be in the public, private or voluntary sector. This module provides an understanding of how organisations can identify and address the needs of internal and external stakeholder. It also provides an introduction to specific marketing concepts like the marketing mix. Students will be exposed to the wider understanding of the definition of marketing, the role of marketing, its functions and different concepts which can aid a marketing practitioner with a focus on the application and adaptation of the marketing theory.</p>
<p><strong>Website Craft and Creation</strong></p>
<p>This module contributes to the knowledge base of students in relation to relevant technique skills needed for this programme. It aims to provide an opportunity for students to learn how to develop the front end web-authoring skills. This module builds foundations for a year two module consumer behaviour and a final year module eCRM and web analytics.</p>
<p><strong>Business Analytics and the Blockchain</strong></p>
<p>The aim of this module is to give you a practical grounding in the skills and techniques necessary to conduct data analytics and anticipate the effects of the blockchain on both short- and long-term strategy. The module introduces the blockchain and the scope of the blockchain industry. Basic statistical models are introduced in this module. As future business leaders, students will learn to understand blockchain, explore blockchain trends, investigate the market disruptions caused by technology and the impact of blockchain in industries worldwide. The module is designed to get you over the basic hurdles you will face when beginning to learn the data analytics and management techniques, and will cover some of the basic tasks that you face as a data analyst and will put you in a position to extend your knowledge of applying your analytical techniques.</p>
<p><strong>Developing Analysis Techniques</strong></p>
<p>Mathematical and statistical skills are essential for various academic programmes. This module introduces essential quantitative methods for modelling and analysing financial data. In addition, statistics and probability concepts will be discussed and applied to various events. These theories will then be used to analyse practical situations and contribute to obtain necessary information for problem solving.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Concepts and Planning</strong></p>
<p>This module aims to develop students understanding of the financial environment. It will look at key sources of information for decision makers and look at the decision maker’s needs. Students will gain an understanding of the key statements in published financial accounts and how to analyse and interpret the information presented.  It will also look at key information for financial decision makers inside organisations. This will include budgetary control, short term and long-term decision making.</p>

								<h4>Modules</h4>
<p><strong>Compulsory modules:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Marketing through Digital Activity</strong></p>
<p>The digital revolution changed what marketing looks like. A sizeable portion of marketing is now done online or on mobile and handheld devices. This module provides a broad understanding of digital marketing. It will focus on understanding, evaluating and developing digital marketing strategy and tactics. In particular, the module will help students develop an understanding of how different digital marketing tools and channels can be used to market products and services. The module will cover such subjects as website marketing and usability, search engine optimisation, display and search advertising, online PR and blogging, introduction to social media and content, email marketing and mobile marketing.</p>
<p><strong>Technologies for the Data Driven Age</strong></p>
<p>This module develops students’ problem solving skills through the medium of programming. The skill of decomposition shows how to break down problems into smaller parts. Writing algorithms supports the development of planning the steps needed to complete the work while planning how to deliver the project helps to develop time management. These skills are all transferable to other problem solving scenarios.</p>
<p><strong>Consumer Behaviour and Consumer Trends</strong></p>
<p>Marketing is a key business function. Central to this is an in depth understanding of how customer desires and decision processes, (consumer behaviour), affect why and how purchases are made. This module introduces students to the complexities of consumer behaviour by analysing and evaluating the impact of the nature and scope of consumer and business buyer behaviour on marketing decisions. The psychology of the decision making processes are studied and the implications for marketers are analysed giving an insight into how to market goods more effectively. Many argue that this is the most interesting of Marketing modules due to the scrutiny of the student’s own psychological motivations.</p>
<p><strong>Research Methods for Service Industries</strong></p>
<p>Organisations frequently require both an understanding of how and why data is acquired, and an ability to collect, analyse and interpret it. These skills are also important if students wish to progress to postgraduate study or careers in consultancy services. This module considers the use of quantitative and qualitative research methods in subject contexts and allows students to develop skills in the collection, analysis and reporting of relevant data. In addition, this module will develop students’ project planning and management skills as a tool to manage the research process.</p>
<p><strong>Creating Effective Information Systems</strong></p>
<p>This module aims to introduce students to business information systems and provide an overview of their use.  The basics of the different types of business software and information systems will be introduced and their application within business environments examined. It brings together a number of ideas that have been introduced in other modules and shows how the flow of information across the business is fundamental to the success of that business. The technological solutions that support this information flow are explored and critiqued. This understanding underpins the modules in the final year that look at specific areas of the business and the data that is collected. </p>

							<h4>Modules</h4>
<p><strong>Compulsory modules:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Practising Responsible Business Behaviours</strong></p>
<p>This module examines the nature of business enterprise and its relationship with wider society, seeking answers to the question: what does it mean for businesses to behave responsibly? In this debate we encounter ideas regarding stakeholder theory, the triple bottom line, corporate social responsibility, business ethics, the role of the state or of supra-national organisations and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Principles of Applied Economics </strong></p>
<p>The module aims to provide knowledge and comprehension of the basic economic principles and techniques related to microeconomics and macroeconomics.</p>
<p><strong>Perspectives on Economic Growth and Development</strong></p>
<p>This module provides an introduction to key economic theories such as economic growth and chance to discuss their application to different countries. You will explore the factors underpinning economic growth such as labour, capital and technological changes and explain how they can contribute to economic growth and stability.</p>
<p><strong>Developing Analysis Techniques</strong></p>
<p>This module introduces essential quantitative methods for modelling and analysing financial data. In addition, statistics and probability concepts will be discussed and applied to various events. These theories will then be used to analyse practical situations.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Policy and Practice</strong></p>
<p>This module provides understanding of quantitative techniques and their usefulness in theoretical and applied economics with focus on developing a deeper understanding of modern macroeconomics.</p>
<p><strong>Market Equilibrium and Market Failure</strong></p>
<p>This module takes an unusual approach by explicitly considering, early in students’ careers, what is involved in making markets ‘work’ and some of the many circumstances in which they may ‘fail’. It is hoped that this will help students to gain a better understanding of the true usefulness of economics in the real world.<strong> </strong></p>
<p>All modules are worth 20 credits unless stated otherwise.</p>

								<h4>Modules</h4>
<p><strong>Compulsory modules:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Econometrics Modelling</strong></p>
<p>The skills of analysing economic and financial data are paramount for proper Financial and Investment Management. This module will give students the ability to discuss and apply econometric techniques to answer research questions using real world data. Emphasis will be placed on what econometric methods to use in different circumstances and how to interpret and evaluate the results of empirical analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Labour Economics</strong></p>
<p>This module explores factors that affect distribution of income, work, opportunities and inequality. We examine current changes in the labour market and the effectiveness of government policy focusing on data rather than theoretical models.</p>
<p><strong>Research Methods</strong></p>
<p>This module considers the use of quantitative and qualitative research methods in subject contexts, and allows students to develop skills in the collection, analysis and reporting of relevant data.</p>
<p><strong>Controversies in International Trade</strong></p>
<p>International trade is extremely controversial. It is claimed to be the engine of much worldwide economic prosperity. It is also blamed for inequality between and within countries and for the rise of populism and nationalism in some parts of the world, amongst other things. Either way, international trade and its surrounding controversies are inseparable from the contemporary business environment.</p>
<p><strong>Optional modules:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Economics of Crime</strong></p>
<p>Crime is an important economic issue for policy makers and government. This module explores various determinants of crime including poverty, education, employment as well as motivations for committing crimes all within the context of economics. This module discusses recent crime issues and examples of policy interventions to reduce crime as well as economic developments and investigates their impact on economy and crime levels.</p>
<p><strong>Industrial Economics</strong></p>
<p>This module is designed for students who are interested in understanding the issues that are present in everyday news: anti-competitive practices, the effect of market power on consumer welfare, incentives for product innovation, and the private and public effects of mergers.</p>
<p><strong>Professional Placement</strong></p>
<p>In this module, students begin their transition from university into the workplace. It is designed to develop skills, knowledge and understanding in a range of career-related personal, professional and key skill areas.</p>
<p><strong>Business, Creativity and Opportunism Skills for the Workplace of Today</strong></p>
<p>This module explores the fundamentals of entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship and the behaviour and skills required to identify and pursue opportunities. You will establish what the behaviours and skills are of an entrepreneur, define creativity and innovation, as well as ask why they are so important to entrepreneurs. We will explore idea generation and evaluation techniques and learn how to recognise enterprise opportunities.</p>

								<h4>Modules</h4>
<p><strong>Compulsory modules:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Research Investigation (40 credits) </strong></p>
<p>The aim of this module is to facilitate and express independent enquiry in a substantial piece of individual self-directed research work. This module provides students with the opportunity to plan and conduct a piece of research through individual and independent activity and to present their findings in using visual aids and in written academic format that meets professional standards. Students will develop research objectives, formulate appropriate methodologies, and apply problem solving and analytical skills in a business context of their choice. You will be able to choose between a traditional dissertation, an organisation-based project, a business research project and a business creation project.</p>
<p>Students have the opportunity to complete the investigation in the form of:</p>
<ul>
<li data-gc-list-depth=""1"" data-gc-list-style=""bullet"">Traditional dissertation</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth=""1"" data-gc-list-style=""bullet"">Research report</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth=""1"" data-gc-list-style=""bullet"">Consultancy project</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth=""1"" data-gc-list-style=""bullet"">Business creation project</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Experimental Economics</strong></p>
<p>This module is to familiarise students with how experiments in economics are used and to illustrate their application to simple economic situations. Rather than relaying theoretical models, this module enables students to design and perform their own experiment in isolation.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Economic Policy</strong></p>
<p>This module builds on and applies previous learning in the Programme to critically examine economic policy issues of contemporary importance. In accordance with the rationale of the Programme this module takes an applied approach and makes use of both macroeconomic and microeconomic modelling as needed.</p>
<p><strong>Economics of Happiness</strong></p>
<p>This module draws on extensive interdisciplinary work that tries to identify the factors that affect happiness. Such factors go beyond the traditional measures of material welfare (such as income) and also focus on things such as relationships, religion, age, marriage, leisure, inequality, war, human rights, democracy, the natural environment, health, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Beyond Economics: Understanding the Changing Global Economy</strong></p>
<p>This module provides students with the opportunity to analyse and evaluate the bridge between politics and economics on an international level.</p>

<p><strong>Compulsory modules:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Managing People in Service Industries: </strong>The module provides a contextualised approach to the management of people in service industries.

							<p class=""lede"">This programme has been accredited by the Royal Geographical Society (with IBG) and approaches these issues from both human and physical geographical perspectives, considering the environment itself along with the people and populations who interact with it. Topics you will explore include ecosystems, biogeography, environmental hazards, nature conservation, sustainability and the global environmental challenges we are facing today. Tackling these issues head-on will challenge you to think about your own environmental values and your relationship with the natural world.</p>

							

						</div>
						<div class=""col"">

							<p>This confrontation of environmental issues is never purely theoretical. We see relevant, real-world experience as an essential part of your learning. You will go beyond the classroom to get out into the field and study the natural world up close. We make the most of our location, in a Yorkshire landscape of moors, National Parks and coastland. Guest speakers from local environmental organisations also strengthen your connection to the region.</p>
<p>As you progress through this degree you will study an increasingly broad range of natural environments. You will take part in residential field trips, which at present include locations such as Malta and Slovenia. This experience of planning and carrying out your own research develops valuable, employable skills and is an essential part of the course and therefore participation on these trips is included within your course fees.</p>
<p>Those who choose to study Environmental Geography usually want to make a difference in the struggle for the health of the planet. Graduates from this subject may go on to have rewarding careers in environmental charities, sustainability management and environmental policy and planning. With the fate of the planet in our hands, having skills to confront the challenges which humanity faces will be invaluable.</p>

      <h3>How you will study</h3>
<p>A relatively new (and growing) development for Higher Education in the UK, Degree Apprenticeships are designed to fill high-level skills gaps by tailoring learning to specific business needs. A Degree Apprenticeship combines full-time paid work and part-time university study, allowing you to gain a full Bachelor’s or Master’s Degree while participating in practical, on-the-job training.</p>
<p>Candidates study using whichever flexible method suits their employer’s needs – whether that is distance learning, blended learning or block mode learning (where the apprentice takes a period of full-time study away from their job).</p>
<p>The qualification is similar to the Higher Apprenticeship, and Degree Apprentices hold full-time employment status rather than student status. However, a Bachelor’s level qualification is optional for Higher Apprentices, university study is a mandatory part of Degree-level apprenticeships.</p>

							<h3 class=""h-border"">Level 1</h3>
<p>The programme is specifically designed so that you will have a foundational Level 1 year that introduces you to the skills required for University-level Literature studies. All our introductory modules seek to equip students with an understanding of historical developments in the form of the written word. These modules provide you with a basic grounding in key texts, major historical moments, and important critical terms that will be applicable across the rest of your degree.</p>

							

						</div>
						<div class=""col"">

							<h4>Modules include:</h4>
<p><strong>Introduction to Literary Studies I<br></strong>In this module you will have the chance to build your confidence in working with literature at degree level. You will engage with a range of texts written prior to the nineteenth century that includes prose, drama, poetry, speeches, letters and articles. Together, we will start to think about some of the ways that literature and history can be brought together and why the study of English Literature remains a popular and important discipline.</p>
<p><strong>Writing, Research and Literature<br></strong>On this module you will learn the basics of academic writing and research at university level. Drawing upon a range of classic and contemporary short stories and poems as your starting point, you will develop a range of skills such as, using the library catalogue, choosing secondary sources, planning essays, developing arguments, and close reading texts, so that you can write and discuss the works that inspire you with confidence and flair.</p>
<p><strong>Forms of Narrative<br></strong>This module introduces students to theories of, debates and practices in narrative. The guiding concern of the discussions is the question of how narratives <em>work </em>and exploring this will involve consideration of a range of narrative strategies (point-of-view, setting in space and time, description) and forms (autobiography, novel, short story, poetry, graphic novels, film). Through the analysis of key texts, students will consider issues such as modes of storytelling, the relationship between different forms of narrative, and the connections between story and interpretation.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction to Literary Studies II</strong><br>On this module we’ll examine some well-known classics alongside more unusual selections that help us to question the social, political, cultural and historical values by which we approach literature. This includes an exciting range of texts across different media and forms, from nineteenth century poetry to early cinema and 1930s nonfiction. Along the way we’ll be thinking about gender, class, war, empire, form, genre, and much more besides.</p>
<p><strong>Theorising Literature: Power and Identity</strong><br>The critic Michel Foucault once wrote that ‘power is everywhere’; on this module we seek to uncover the ways that economic, social, and cultural power is portrayed and exerted through the written word. Who has the power in a literary text? And how do we as readers discern this? We will discuss these issues as they relate to identity politics and the intersections between class, gender, race, sexuality, ability, nation, and age in selected literary works.</p>
<p><strong>Canonicity</strong><br>This module prepares students to reflect on the study of Literature at undergraduate level by introducing them to two key, overarching concepts: the idea of literary value and the canon. The module is designed to complement semester 1 modules in which issues of literary value and the canon are raised, albeit in less detail, and to provide a meta-context for students to learn and reflect on <em>why</em> they study <em>what</em> they study at university as well as, more precisely, how canonical assumptions can influence their reading and writing.</p>

								<h3 class=""h-border"">Level 2</h3>
<p>In Level 2 you are able to follow a historical strand throughout your degree, focusing on literature from specific periods, as well as taking modules in more specialist areas such as science-fiction, American Literature, and war narratives. You will be able to ‘shape’ your degree pathway according to your own interests. Our employability module ‘Literature at Work’ encourages students to consider their professional and transferable skills, and how they might utilise them in the working world, as well as allowing students to undertake work-related projects and have the opportunity to meet professionals from industries including publishing, journalism, and teaching. This innovative approach to employability has been extremely popular with our students over the past few years.</p>

							</div>
							<div class=""col"">

								<h4>Modules include:</h4>
<p><strong>Literary Theory<br></strong>Is it proper to remove literary texts from their historical contexts, or is historical awareness essential to any understanding of the text? Is it really the case that a text can mean anything to anybody, or are there more objective ways of understanding what texts are and how they work? What is actually happening when we read literature? And what is ‘literature’ anyway? This module will engage with the fundamental questions lying behind the discipline of literary studies. Through a direct discussion of theoretical texts, it will examine concepts such as beauty, culture and language from a range of perspectives. It will equip students with a toolbox of interpretative procedures that will enable them to offer insightful readings of any text written in English, irrespective of when and where it was published.</p>
<p><strong>Civil War to Civil Society: British Literature, 1640-1740<br></strong>The English Civil War and execution of Charles I, the Commonwealth, the ‘Glorious Revolution’, and the Restoration of the Crown led to a period of great literary production – as well as suspicion from those in power towards writers and publishers. This module will engage with the ways in which literature challenged and negotiated what it meant to be ‘civil’ in the 17th and 18th centuries. How did writers explain seismic changes to a growing readership? How did new voices (the working class, women, writers of colour, dissenting writers) enter the conversation? What new <em>kinds</em> of literature emerged to make sense of events and what kind of community was created through reading?</p>
<p><strong>Adaptations<br></strong>We look at the different ways books and films tell stories, and what happens to literature and literary characters when they get ‘translated’ onto the screen. In addition to examining specific examples of film adaptation, students can choose to experiment creatively on a project of their own.</p>
<p><strong>Science Fiction for Survival<br></strong>Drawing on a range of theoretical and critical concepts around utopianism, the module will consider landmarks in the history of SF in order to develop students’ understanding of key concerns relevant to the genre. The title ‘Science Fiction for Survival’ aims to highlight the way in which science fiction, through its attention to both technology and ideology, encourages readers/viewers to consider the way in which humanity’s post-industrial choices have impacted directly on the well-being of the planet and its diverse human and non-human inhabitants. Students on the module will have the opportunity to get involved with the project Terra Two: An Ark for Off-World Survival (<a href=""https://yorkstjohnterratwo.com/"" data-gc-link=""https://yorkstjohnterratwo.com/""><strong>https://yorkstjohnterratwo.com/</strong></a>), and to develop content for the site.</p>
<p><strong>Mapping America<br></strong>This module introduces students to the relationship between American literature and physical and mythical/symbolic spaces, and explores the ways in which this space is imagined and represented in a range of texts. In American culture, concepts of space and setting have a particular relevance that dates back, for example, to events such as the Declaration of Independence, the founding of civic spaces, and the Californian Gold Rush. The rationale behind this module is to ask students to think creatively, critically, and innovatively about physical space and literature, and explore the relationship between American socio-economic history, and the development of a specifically American literary tradition.</p>
<p><strong>Literature at Work<br></strong>This module will enable English Literature students to engage in discussions about a range of career trajectories relevant to their degree on both a practical and ideological level. Crucially, the module will facilitate reflective thinking about skillsets and their relationship to students’ career aims. Team work and project management are integral features, with students working in groups to develop, plan, and execute a project or alternatively, to engage in work-place learning through an external placement. Guest speakers will introduce a variety of graduate career pathways, potentially including publishing, research, teaching, marketing, and journalism.</p>
<p><strong>Conflicting Words<br></strong>This module provides an opportunity to read texts produced by and written about major conflicts of the twentieth and early twenty first centuries. We will start with the mechanised horror of the Western Front and work our way through the Second World War, the Spanish Civil War, Vietnam, the Troubles, 9/11 and the War on Terror. We read texts by writers as diverse as Martha Gellhorn, George Orwell and Kurt Vonnegut and examine the complex relationship between language, experience and memory.</p>
<p><strong>Revolution and Response: British Literature, 1740-1840<br></strong>Beginning with the ‘rise of sensibility’, this module will explore the idea of ‘revolution’ and the myriad ways in which the literature published in these decades agitated for and responded to political upheavals and changes as well as ‘revolutions’ in literary tastes and production, gender roles and expectations, the role of literature, and the relationship between individuals and society. Writers took full advantage of an increasingly literate population and met an insatiable desire for print with an outpouring of plays, poetry, ‘novels’, treatises, periodicals, and newspapers. This module will engage with the idea of ‘revolution’ through a wide range of topics and texts, including poetry, prose, and drama.</p>
<p><strong>From Harlem to Hip-Hop: African American Literature and Culture<br></strong>Obama...Beyoncé...the 'Black Lives Matter' movement. Without doubt, the African American experience is a major influence on our contemporary political, cultural, and social landscape. Starting with the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s and continuing through to the present day, we will discuss key African American novels, plays, and poems alongside music (including jazz, soul, blues, and hip-hop), film, art, and political writings in order to better understand the ways that black writers respond to and shape American culture and history.</p>
<p><strong>Sick Novels: Literature and Disease<br></strong>On this module we’ll be looking at the ways in which diseases are represented in novels from several different periods. What sorts of things can disease suggest in the literary text, and what kinds of associations come with different diseases? Why do some diseases seem to appear in many novels (tuberculosis and cancer, for example) and why are some less often written about? What kinds of anxieties about society do diseases embody or allow the author to explore?</p>
<p><strong>Shakespeare: Perspectives<br></strong>This is an exciting module which will explore Shakespeare’s plays in their early modern contexts but also understand them as written for performance. We will also explore them as modern/post-modern texts in reception. The module engages with a range of theoretical approaches, from new historicist to feminist and queer readings.</p>

<p>In your final year of study, you will again be able to choose a selection of modules from the historical strand, or modules in specialised areas of study. By this stage of your degree, you will be ready to take on a bigger role in the management of your learning and the development of your skills as a reader, writer, and literary critic. You might find yourself leading a class discussion, or doing a non-assessed presentation in a seminar.

<p><strong>Dissertation<br></strong>In your final year, you will be ready to take on a bigger role in the management of your learning. Students write a dissertation (an extended project that runs for the whole academic year) on the subject of their choice, and with the support of an academic supervisor. In many ways, this is the intellectual culmination of the degree, as students become independent researchers and are required to manage their own academic project. Many of our students note that this is one of the most enjoyable sections of their degree, as they are specialising in a literary topic that they are passionate about, and are putting into practice the skills they have accrued during their time at YSJ.</p>
<p><strong>The Victorian Novel: Realism, Sensation, Naturalism<br></strong>On this module we’ll focus on the ways in which the novel as a form was developed, challenged, and experimented with in the Victorian period. We’ll consider how the novel engages with and represents social issues in the period, but we’ll also look at the ways in which the novel form itself adapted and transformed as a vehicle of expression: from realist texts which set out to depict believable and probable events and characters, to science fiction, the sensation novel, romance, mystery, and adventure.</p>
<p><strong>The Experimental Century<br></strong>By the beginning of the twentieth century, many of the religious, philosophical and cultural assumptions of the Western hemisphere had been smashed into pieces. In this pessimistic moment flourished a range of aesthetic movements whose radical call was to ‘make it new’. Their desire to reconstitute the tradition would produce original, playful and subversive approaches to old-fashioned forms. And their experiments would expand the boundaries of culture until it encompassed a whole range of new identities, new concepts and new genres. This module will introduce students to these restless modernists, and explore the consequences of their work in twentieth century culture. Along the way it will examine how the Civil Rights Movement, feminism, and queer subcultures turned experimental aesthetics to new, politically radical ends.</p>
<p><strong>Gothic Origins<br></strong>‘The Gothic’, according to David Punter, ‘arises on the sites of vanished cultural territories’ (2000). The point of ‘vanishing’ conceals and reveals the origin of this ‘contested, maligned, and misunderstood’ (Carol M. Davison, 2009) mode of writing. This module will provide an opportunity for students to engage with the ‘origins’ of Gothic literature and conventions, exploring the ways in which the Gothic persists and adapts to different historical and cultural contexts. We will be reading poetry and prose, drama and non-fiction throughout the module, as well as considering other media (art, film, sound) and critical theories of the Gothic.</p>
<p><strong>The Making of Modern Drama<br></strong>This module examines aspects of theatrical experimentation over the last century, and its impact on the contemporary stage. In addition to comparing the aims and achievements of different theatrical movements, students may undertake a creative project (e.g. writing a script or designing a stage-production) in response to what they have learned.</p>
<p><strong>Research Now I and II<br></strong>This module allows final year students to be involved with current staff research projects. The topics or ‘strands’ on offer will reflect current research or the research specialisms of the teaching team.</p>
<p><strong>American Radicals<br></strong>This module will examine a selection of texts from twentieth century American literature and relate the works to their cultural, social and political backgrounds. The module will focus on texts that demonstrate formal innovation and experimentation, and will reflect the plurality of twentieth century American experience. Students might read Native American, African American, Chicana, Chinese-American texts alongside literature produced in the wake of radical social change such as Beat writing, Vietnam narratives, and responses to 9/11.</p>
<p><strong>Writing the Caribbean<br></strong>This module will examine a range of texts from the Anglophone and Anglocreole Caribbean, a region that has produced two Nobel Prize winners in Literature (Derek Walcott &amp; V.S. Naipaul). The aim is to introduce students to a range of writing from and about the Caribbean which reveal the longstanding global dimensions of this writing and the ways in which this is currently being marked and remembered. The close connections between Britain and the Caribbean will be a particular focus, both in a historical and contemporary context.</p>
<p><strong>Cultures of the Now<br></strong>This module encourages students to consolidate their understanding of the history of literature by examining a range of texts from a variety of locations – Europe and the USA, but also Africa and the Asian subcontinent – in order to get a grip on the strange paradoxes of our own global moment. Is the world a fragmented assortment of local traditions, or a conformist monoculture? What do those in one part of the world owe to those living in another? And is the popularity of literary texts which seek to represent and understand ‘the other’ something to celebrate, or simply another manifestation of consumerism?</p>
<p><strong>Gender and Sexualities<br></strong>When it comes to issues of gender and sexuality, what is natural and what is cultural? How have gender debates informed popular culture and critical theory? How are different genders and sexualities presented in film and literature? And how do different cultural groups use popular culture and literature to reinforce, challenge, transgress or disrupt traditional gender expectations? Coming in the final semester of third year, this module challenges students to draw on all of the skills, theories and approaches they have rehearsed throughout the degree to confront, explore and interrogate the representation of gender roles and sexuality in popular culture.</p>

							<h4>English Literature</h4>
<p>In English Literature, our philosophy is simple: <em>words matter</em>. Words shape the world we live in (books can and have changed the world) and the connections between the written page and the concerns of the ‘real’ world are a crucial part of the programme. Overall, the degree will enable you to develop your expertise as a reader and critic of a range of literary materials, whilst also supporting you in the development of a portfolio of professional skills which will aid you in the wider job market. As you become adept at independent learning, you will become a more sophisticated reader of texts, and you will find that your confidence as a writer and as a critic will increase as your degree progresses. </p>
<p>English Literature is a rich and vibrant area of study. At York St John University, we are a dynamic, engaged, and research-active team who are committed to providing our students with a cutting-edge education. By studying English Literature, you will have the opportunity to learn about a range of different genres, historical periods, and literary forms.</p>

							

						</div>
						<div class=""col"">

							<h4>History</h4>
<p>On the History programme you will experience a wide range of teaching methods and techniques. From lectures and interactive workshops to seminars with other students, we encourage both independent and collaborative learning. In class contact time, you will examine arguments made by historians and the key debates between them. You will interrogate primary sources in print and in other media. You will learn how to advance your own arguments and think critically about the past. There are also opportunities to go on field trips within the historic city of York and beyond, to uncover the past in fantastic archives and the built environment all around us.</p>
<p>The History programme at York St John University offers a diverse range of modules, from medieval to modern history, with global scope. Studying history is not simply to understand the events of the past. Our team actively encourages your critical thinking and analytical skills to develop your abilities as an independent historian.</p>

							<h3 class=""h-horder"">Level 1</h3>
<p>The programme is specifically designed so that you will have a foundational Level 1 year that introduces you to the skills required for University-level Literature and History. All our introductory Literature modules seek to equip students with an understanding of historical developments in the form of the written word. These modules provide you with a basic grounding in key texts, major historical moments, and important critical terms that will be applicable across the rest of your degree. </p>
<p>Our introductory history modules allow you to explore different historical methods and perspectives on the past. You will learn key skills important for future years on the degree, including close primary source analysis and critical approaches to historiography.</p>

							

						</div>
						<div class=""col"">

							<p><strong>Introduction to Literary Studies I<br></strong>In this module you will have the chance to build your confidence in working with literature at degree level. You will engage with a range of texts written prior to the nineteenth century that includes prose, drama, poetry, speeches, letters and articles. Together, we will start to think about some of the ways that literature and history can be brought together and why the study of English Literature remains a popular and important discipline.</p>
<p> <strong>Writing, Research and Literature<br></strong>On this module you will learn the basics of academic writing and research at University level. Drawing upon a range of classic and contemporary short stories and poems as your starting point, you will develop a range of skills such as, using the library catalogue, choosing secondary sources, planning essays, developing arguments, and close reading texts, so that you can write and discuss the works that inspire you with confidence and flair.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction to Literary Studies II<br></strong>On this module we’ll examine some well-known classics alongside more unusual selections that help us to question the social, political, cultural and historical values by which we approach literature. This includes an exciting range of texts across different media and forms, from nineteenth century poetry to early cinema and 1930s nonfiction. Along the way we’ll be thinking about gender, class, war, empire, form, genre, and much more besides.</p>
<p><strong>Theorising Literature: Power and Identity<br></strong>The critic Michel Foucault once wrote that ‘power is everywhere’; on this module we seek to uncover the ways that economic, social, and cultural power is portrayed and exerted through the written word. Who has the power in a literary text? And how do we as readers discern this? We will discuss these issues as they relate to identity politics and the intersections between class, gender, race, sexuality, ability, nation, and age in selected literary works.</p>
<p><strong>Canonicity<br></strong>This module prepares students to reflect on the study of Literature at undergraduate level by introducing them to two key, overarching concepts: the idea of literary value and the canon. The module is designed to complement semester 1 modules in which issues of literary value and the canon are raised, albeit in less detail, and to provide a meta-context for students to learn and reflect on <em>why</em> they study <em>what</em> they study at university as well as, more precisely, how canonical assumptions can influence their reading and writing. </p>
<p><strong>Researching and Presenting the Past<br></strong>This module is designed to provide students with a foundation for the study of history at university. The course will focus on the key skills of researching and writing for essays and exams as well as aiming to enhance students' ability to analyse and evaluate primary and secondary sources. The module familiarises students with a range of historical sources and with the techniques required for their interpretation and evaluation. The course also provides a grounding in the development of history as a discipline, for instance through a focus on the early origins of history in antiquity to the modern day.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>War and Society<br></strong>This module focuses on the nature and significance of war in society. Students will develop the skills of comparative analysis, by examining wars of different types in distinct periods and exploring contemporary historical debates about the relationship between war and society. </p>
<p><strong>Contemporary Crisis<br></strong>The aim of this module is to introduce students to a series of significant domestic and international crises that can be regarded as marking a critical threshold in the history of the contemporary world. Study of these crises individually builds an understanding of the structures, mechanisms and character of the post-1945 world. The module promotes verbal and written communication skills appropriate to level 1 and prepares students for specialist modules at levels 2 and 3. </p>
<p><strong>The Making of Britain<br></strong>This survey module offers a broad history of the British Isles, from domestic and international perspectives. While the course will focus on British history, students will also learn about the broader history of the world, and the influence this history had on the development of Britain. This approach will ensure students are introduced to the history of Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas, and their relationship and importance to the history of an emerging Britain in the world. The broad themes of ‘power’, ‘identity’ and the ‘global’ will be run throughout the module. </p>
<p><strong>Empires<br></strong>This module is designed to enable students to understand the experience of imperialism by comparing empires from diverse geographical and chronological contexts. It will allow for an understanding of the term ‘Empire’, and the importance of imperial powers throughout history. It will encourage comparative skills and source analysis. </p>
<p><strong>The Visible Past<br></strong>This module will introduce participants to the study of historic buildings and to their appreciation as sources for the social, economic, political, military, religious and cultural history of England. The focus is on the ways in which history is expressed in the built environment and through material culture. The module uses the buildings, spaces and resources in and around the city of York to explore this aspect of the study of history, and places a particular emphasis on York’s medieval inheritance, focusing on the growth and development of monasteries and castles in Yorkshire. </p>
<p><strong>Popular Protest<br></strong>The module examines the causes, dynamics and impact of popular protest in a variety of historical contexts, using the study of popular protest as an example of ‘history from below’ and as an introduction to the analytical and methodological approaches involved in the study of social history. </p>
<p><strong>America’s Century<br></strong>The international history of the 20th Century was marked by the rise to global pre-eminence of a single super-power, the United States of America, displacing the former hegemony of Britain and the nations of Western Europe. The rise of American power had a profound impact upon the international community, whether her European allies, her communist enemies or the emergent nations of the developing world.</p>

								<p>At Level 2 you have the chance to follow your own writing and research interests, and select the modules that most appeal to you. As a joint honours student, you will take an employability module with either English Literature or History. Both of these modules encourage students to consider their professional and transferable skills, and how they might utilise them in the working world, as well as allowing students to undertake work-related projects and have the opportunity to meet professionals from industries including publishing, journalism, and teaching. This innovative approach to employability has been extremely popular with our students over the past few years. </p>
<p><strong>Modules include:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Literary Theory<br></strong>Is it proper to remove literary texts from their historical contexts, or is historical awareness essential to any understanding of the text? Is it really the case that a text can mean anything to anybody, or are there more objective ways of understanding what texts are and how they work? What is actually happening when we read literature? And what is ‘literature’ anyway? This module will engage with the fundamental questions lying behind the discipline of literary studies. </p>
<p><strong>Mapping America<br></strong>This module introduces students to the relationship between American literature and physical and mythical/symbolic spaces, and explores the ways in which this space is imagined and represented in a range of texts. The rationale behind this module is to ask students to think creatively, critically, and innovatively about physical space and literature, and explore the relationship between American socio-economic history, and the development of a specifically American literary tradition.</p>
<p><strong>Science Fiction for Survival<br></strong>Drawing on a range of theoretical and critical concepts around utopianism, the module will consider landmarks in the history of science fiction in order to develop students’ understanding of key concerns relevant to the genre. The title ‘Science Fiction for Survival’ aims to highlight the way in which science fiction, through its attention to both technology and ideology, encourages readers/viewers to consider the way in which humanity’s post-industrial choices have impacted directly on the well-being of the planet and its diverse human and non-human inhabitants.  </p>
<p><strong>Conflicting Words<br></strong>This module provides an opportunity to read texts produced by and written about major conflicts of the twentieth and early twenty first centuries. We will start with the mechanised horror of the Western Front and work our way through the Second World War, the Spanish Civil War, Vietnam, the Troubles, 9/11 and the War on Terror. We read texts by writers as diverse as Martha Gellhorn, George Orwell and Kurt Vonnegut and examine the complex relationship between language, experience and memory.</p>
<p><strong>Sick Novels: Literature and Disease<br></strong>On this module we’ll be looking at the ways in which diseases are represented in novels from several different periods. What sorts of things can disease suggest in the literary text, and what kinds of associations come with different diseases? Why do some diseases seem to appear in many novels (tuberculosis and cancer, for example) and why are some less often written about? What kinds of anxieties about society do diseases embody or allow the author to explore?</p>
<p><strong>Shakespeare: Perspectives<br></strong>This is an exciting module which will explore Shakespeare’s plays in their early modern contexts but also understand them as written for performance. We will also explore them as modern/post-modern texts in reception. The module engages with a range of theoretical approaches, from new historicist to feminist and queer readings. </p>
<p><strong>From Harlem to Hip-Hop: African American Literature and Culture<br></strong>Without doubt, the African American experience is a major influence on our contemporary political, cultural, and social landscape. Starting with the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s and continuing through to the present day, we will discuss key African American novels, plays, and poems alongside music (including jazz, soul, blues, and hip-hop), film, art, and political writings in order to better understand the ways that black writers respond to and shape American culture and history.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>Civil War to Civil Society: British Literature, 1640-1740<br></strong>The English Civil War and execution of Charles I, the Commonwealth, the ‘Glorious Revolution’, and the Restoration of the Crown led to a period of great literary production – as well as suspicion from those in power towards writers and publishers. This module will engage with the ways in which literature challenged and negotiated what it meant to be ‘civil’ in the 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> centuries. </p>
<p><strong>Adaptations<br></strong>We look at the different ways books and films tell stories, and what happens to literature and literary characters when they get ‘translated’ onto the screen. In addition to examining specific examples of film adaptation, students can choose to experiment creatively on a project of their own.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>Literature at Work<br></strong>This module will enable English Literature students to engage in discussions about a range of career trajectories relevant to their degree on both a practical and ideological level. Crucially, the module will facilitate reflective thinking about skillsets and their relationship to students’ career aims. Team work and project management are integral features, with students working in groups to develop, plan, and execute a project or alternatively, to engage in work-place learning through an external placement. Guest speakers will introduce a variety of graduate career pathways, potentially including publishing, research, teaching, marketing, and journalism.</p>
<p><strong>Revolution and Response: British Literature, 1740-1840<br></strong>Beginning with the ‘rise of sensibility’, this module will explore the idea of ‘revolution’ and the myriad ways in which the literature published in these decades agitated for and responded to political upheavals and changes as well as ‘revolutions’ in literary tastes and production, gender roles and expectations, the role of literature, and the relationship between individuals and society. This module will engage with the idea of ‘revolution’ through a wide range of topics and texts, including poetry, prose, and drama. </p>
<p><strong>The World After Rome<br></strong>This module looks at those nations and states which emerged in the vacuum created by the fall of the Roman Empire. We cover the period 500 – 1000, and look in some depth at a number of different polities. This is the period of Bede, Alcuin, Charlemagne, Gregory the Great and Louis the Pious. It is a period of dramatic social, political and economic change. It is the period where our nations are born. It will tackle the notion that the period after Rome was a dark age, bereft of learning, literature and law. </p>
<p><strong>The Age of Revolution, c. 1780-1830<br></strong>The module aims to explore an important period in modern European history, the era of the French and industrial revolutions. The main events of the period are studied from a variety of social, political, intellectual and cultural perspectives and students are given the opportunity to pursue individual avenues of interest and research. </p>
<p><strong>The Flowering of the Middle Ages<br></strong>The aim of the module is to introduce students to the structures of medieval society in western Christendom and to the processes of change as well as adaptation brought about by conquest, settlement and travel. The course explores the material conditions, social organisation, political structures and world perceptions of western Christendom in the high middle ages and examines the historiographical and conceptual debates on the significance of the period.</p>
<p><strong>Reds! The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Communism<br></strong>This module examines the history of the Soviet Union from political, social, cultural, economic and military standpoints. The Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 set in train a process by which the world would become divided into two diametrically opposed ideological camps throughout much of the twentieth century. The Revolution is, therefore, a seminal event in our understanding the international history of the last century.</p>
<p><strong>History, Film and Television<br></strong>This module studies the value of a variety of film and televisual evidence, including documentary, feature film, television film, propaganda film, newsreels and television news film, as a historical sources. The module explores the role which such media have played, and continue to play, in shaping historical development. It promotes research into relevant primary visual material, as well as engagement with secondary sources and critical scholarship concerning the relationship between film and history.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Making of Modern America<br></strong>The module aims to examine the political, social, economic, religious and cultural response of a rural nation undergoing rapid industrialisation, urbanisation and immigration. It will do so by evaluating, through the use of relevant sources, the historiographical debates surrounding the key themes of the period, as well as a range of literary, filmic, musical, artistic and popular cultural sources of the period as responses to their time.</p>
<p><strong>International Organisations in the 20<sup>th</sup> century<br></strong>This module seeks to give students an understanding of the function, impact and practices of international organisations during the twentieth century in the maintenance of international peace and security; on the global economy; and on international society. It will highlight and explain the origins and formation of a number of international organisations including the League of Nations, the United Nations, NATO, the IMF and World Bank, and the European Union.</p>
<p><strong>History: Community and Culture<br></strong>The key aim of this module is to offer students work-related learning. The module will allow students to explore career opportunities in areas that will be of value and relevance in their future working lives. It will engage them with thinking about how the skills they have acquired during their history degree can be utilised within those careers. As a part of this module, students will EITHER: 1. undertake a placement of a minimum of ten days. Students will seek out their own placement, with advice on how to do so that will be embedded in specific classes held during the module. OR: 2. undertake a work-related project, approved by the tutor, involving practical elements, broadly defined. </p>
<p><strong>Plague, Piety and Power<br></strong>This module introduces students to the history of late medieval and early modern Europe, focusing on the themes of social, political, cultural and economic development during the period. The course examines the shift from medieval to renaissance through study of the development of political institutions, national and individual identities, language, literature and culture, and social constructs. The module also engages with debates on the impact of particular moments of historical significance, such as the devastation of plague and the discovery of the New World. </p>
<p><strong>From Slavery to Freedom<br></strong>This module examines the major historical interpretations and cultural developments concerning the experience of African Americans under slavery and freedom. It explains the forces underlying the origins, development and abolition of the institution of slavery in the United States, and assesses the nature and significance of the American slave system and the responses of African Americans (through slave narratives) and white Americans to the institution of slavery, their inter-relationship after the demise of slavery and the emergence of cultural expression among African Americans. </p>
<p><strong>The Age of Anxiety: Culture and Society in the USA, 1929-60<br></strong>Arguably the period from the Great Crash of 1929 to the departure of President Eisenhower from the White House in 1961 was one of continual anxiety for Americans. Although the period was bookended by unprecedented affluence, first in the 1920s, and then in the post-Second World War era, it was also a peculiarly traumatic period in American domestic life. In this module we seek to analyse and assess the nature and impact of the major upheavals in American life that characterise the period.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sleeping Dragon: China 1911-1997<br></strong>In the 1980s the People’s Republic of China began to emerge from the slumbers of communist isolation to take its place as a significant regional, and an increasingly important global, power. Even before this commentators had begun to describe the People's Republic of China as a new ‘superpower’ and the contemporary view is that China may be destined to surpass even the USA in terms of strategic and economic ‘clout’. Yet historically China has consistently failed to realise its national potential. This module examines the history of China’s efforts to shake off the shackles of its semi-colonial past and realise its full potential during the critical period from the 1911 Revolution to the economic reforms of Deng Xiaoping.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Europe in the Age of Nationalism, 1848-1914<br></strong>The module examines the history of the European ‘Great Powers’ and the relations between them in the late-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, with particular reference to the growth of nationalism and its impact on Europe in that period. It explores the relationship between ideology and society in a specific historical context, building on the conceptual approaches introduced at level 1, and providing a foundation for more specialist study of modern European, British and international history at level 3. </p>
<p><strong>The Power of the Past in Early Modern Britain<br></strong>Early Modern Britain had a rich historical culture, which supported social and political hierarchies, and claims to power and the legitimacy of the monarchy, the church and governmental institutions. Surveying some of the most important phases of British History from the perspective of how the past was interpreted, memorialised, contested, the course aims to provide students with fresh ways of understanding the course and impact of political, religious and intellectual change during the period.</p>

We’ll consider how the novel engages with and represents social issues in the period, but we’ll also look at the ways in which the novel form itself adapted and transformed as a vehicle of expression: from realist texts which set out to depict believable and probable events and characters, to science fiction, the sensation novel, romance, mystery, and adventure.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>The Experimental Century<br></strong>By the beginning of the twentieth century, many of the religious, philosophical and cultural assumptions of the Western hemisphere had been smashed into pieces. In this pessimistic moment flourished a range of aesthetic movements whose radical call was to ‘make it new’. This module will introduce students to these restless modernists, and explore the consequences of their work in twentieth century culture. Along the way it will examine how the Civil Rights Movement, feminism, and queer subcultures turned experimental aesthetics to new, politically radical ends. </p>
<p><strong>Gothic Origins<br></strong>‘The Gothic’, according to David Punter, ‘arises on the sites of vanished cultural territories’ (2000). The point of ‘vanishing’ conceals and reveals the origin of this ‘contested, maligned, and misunderstood’ (Carol M. Davison, 2009) mode of writing. This module will provide an opportunity for students to engage with the ‘origins’ of Gothic literature and conventions, exploring the ways in which the Gothic persists and adapts to different historical and cultural contexts. We will be reading poetry and prose, drama and non-fiction throughout the module, as well as considering other media (art, film, sound) and critical theories of the Gothic. </p>
<p><strong>The Making of Modern Drama<br></strong>This module examines aspects of theatrical experimentation over the last century, and its impact on the contemporary stage. In addition to comparing the aims and achievements of different theatrical movements, students may undertake a creative project (e.g. writing a script or designing a stage-production) in response to what they have learned. </p>
<p><strong>Research Now I and II </strong><strong><br></strong>This module recognizes the interest students have in the research culture and open environment that we have cultivated at YSJU. It allows final year students to respond to current and ongoing research projects within the lecturing team, building on their research skills and supporting the specific skills demanded of final-year work and dissertation modules.</p>
<p><strong>American Radicals: Outside the Canon<br></strong>This module will examine a selection of texts from twentieth century American literature and relate the works to their cultural, social and political backgrounds. The module will focus on texts that demonstrate formal innovation and experimentation, and will reflect the plurality of twentieth century American experience. Students might read Native American, African American, Chicana, Chinese-American texts alongside literature produced in the wake of radical social change such as Beat writing, Vietnam narratives, and responses to 9/11. </p>
<p><strong>Writing the Caribbean<br></strong>This module will examine a range of texts from the Anglophone and Anglocreole Caribbean, a region that has produced two Nobel Prize winners in Literature (Derek Walcott &amp; V.S. Naipaul). The aim is to introduce students to a range of writing from and about the Caribbean which reveal the longstanding global dimensions of this writing and the ways in which this is currently being marked and remembered. The close connections between Britain and the Caribbean will be a particular focus, both in a historical and contemporary context. </p>
<p><strong>Cultures of the Now: Contemporary Writing<br></strong>This module encourages students to consolidate their understanding of the history of literature by examining a range of texts from a variety of locations – Europe and the USA, but also Africa and the Asian subcontinent – in order to get a grip on the strange paradoxes of our own global moment. Is the world a fragmented assortment of local traditions, or a conformist monoculture? What do those in one part of the world owe to those living in another? And is the popularity of literary texts which seek to represent and understand ‘the other’ something to celebrate, or simply another manifestation of consumerism? </p>
<p><strong>Gender and Sexualities<br></strong>When it comes to issues of gender and sexuality, what is natural and what is cultural? How have gender debates informed popular culture and critical theory? And how do different cultural groups use popular culture and literature to reinforce, challenge, transgress or disrupt traditional gender expectations? Coming in the final semester of third year, this module challenges students to draw on all of the skills, theories and approaches they have rehearsed throughout the degree to confront, explore and interrogate the representation of gender roles and sexuality in popular culture. </p>
<p><strong>History: Special Study<br></strong>The design, research and presentation of an extended independent research project in History. You will address a specific topic in depth, using relevant primary and secondary sources and demonstrate an advanced critical understanding of theoretical and/or historiographical approaches as appropriate. The dissertation will demonstrate advanced written academic skills and the capacity to construct a sustained independent argument in relation to the chosen topic.</p>
<p><strong>Early Victorian England<br></strong>The module explores aspects of the impact of the industrial revolution on England in the first half of the nineteenth century. Concentrating mainly on the period from the 1830s to the 1850s, it analyses the consequences of the industrial revolution for economic, social and political life, and examines the ways in which the early Victorians responded to the changes that were transforming their world. </p>
<p><strong>US Conflict on the East Asian Mainland<br></strong>Forty years after its conclusion the Vietnam War remains one of the most controversial conflicts of modern times. While efforts have continually been made to learn the ‘lessons’ of Vietnam it has been argued that the very occurrence of the war was the result of a failure to learn the lessons of the Korean conflict that preceded it, and with which it shares some obvious characteristics, though there are also some very marked differences. This module offers students an opportunity to explore the rich historical debates surrounding both the Vietnam War and the somewhat less well-known conflict on the Korean peninsula. </p>
<p><strong>The Wars of the Roses<br></strong>This module explores in detail one of the most politically volatile periods of English history, encompassing deposition, regicide, civil war and enduring controversy. Students will be introduced to the key events of the Wars of the Roses and current scholarly debates, including examination of specified primary sources. The course focuses on the years 1450-85, analysing the reasons for the instability and the nature of political society as well as the influence of war and political turmoil on social and cultural change.</p>
<p><strong>The Empire Strikes Back: Mikhail Gorbachev and the Collapse of the Soviet Union<br></strong>The collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991 brought a dramatic end to a Soviet empire that had been crumbling for decades. It also marked a definitive end to the Cold War and for a short time seemed to vindicate commentators who had viewed Soviet decline as the ‘end of history’; the end of ideological conflict in the world. In light of this complex legacy, this module will explore the dramatic events of the final years of the Cold War and will place the collapse of the USSR in its proper domestic and international contexts. </p>
<p><strong>The English Revolution<br></strong>The English Revolution was a seminal period in British history, encompassing civil wars, regicide, and the transformation of political authority and practice that were to have profound long-term effects. Alongside the events and personalities involved in the English Revolution, students will learn about the institutions of the early modern English state, including the church, the courts, local county committees and offices, and parliament, and how they all understood and engaged with threats to the political order. </p>
<p><strong>The Atlantic World in the Eighteenth Century<br></strong>The aim of the module is to examine aspects of the history and historiography of the Atlantic world in the eighteenth century. The main focus will be on developments and interactions within the British Atlantic world, but the broader American, European and African contexts will be taken into account in the consideration of specific themes and events as well as in the discussion of the historiographical issues raised by the concept of ‘Atlantic history’. </p>
<p><strong>The Nation Divided: The Civil War Era in American Life<br></strong>This module will examine the history of the American Civil War. It will confront and evaluate the historical debates surrounding the American Civil War and examine the social and political forces which have shaped subsequent historical and popular cultural portrayals of the conflict. It will provide opportunities for students to contemplate the significance of historical memory, and will enable students to apply a range of advanced analytical and critical tools to the study of the history and memory of the American Civil War.</p>
<p><strong>The Great Society: America in the 1960s<br></strong>The period that falls approximately between the election of John F. Kennedy as president of the United States in 1960 and the departure of Richard M. Nixon from that office was an incredibly tumultuous time for the USA: the country was convulsed by domestic upheaval; it embarked on a period of intense domestic reform in an effort to create what President Lyndon Johnson called the ‘Great Society’; and it became bogged down in a seemingly endless war in Vietnam. This module provides an opportunity for students to study the major themes and developments in the USA’s domestic and foreign affairs during this seminal period.</p>
<p><strong>The Origins of the Second World War<br></strong>The module examines the challenge to international order presented during the 1930s by Germany, Italy and Japan; it also analyses the response of Britain, France, Russia and the USA, and the reasons why tensions between these nations escalated into the Second World War. In doing so, the module assesses the historiographical debates concerning international relations in the 1930s.</p>
<p><strong>Late Anglo-Saxon England<br></strong>This module looks very closely at the Anglo-Saxon world. Although it will present students with a good narrative awareness of Anglo-Saxon history from its beginnings, through Alfred the Great, Bede and Edgar, with a greater focus placed on the reign of Æthelred and the ultimate conquest of the nation by Cnut. Students will engage with a wide variety of different source materials: the Anglo-Saxon chronicle, Poetry, political tracts, Hagiographical works as well as the law codes produced by the state. Students will also consider the use of archaeology and material culture in elucidating such a distant and foreign past. </p>
<p><strong>Late Victorian and Edwardian Britain<br></strong>The module examines key themes in the social and political history of Britain in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, building on the work of introductory modules at level 1 and broader period surveys at level 2. It combines the advanced study of historiography with the examination of primary source material and is intended to enable students to demonstrate and develop their critical, analytical and communication skills at a level appropriate to the final year of an undergraduate degree programme.</p>

<li data-gc-list-depth=""1"" data-gc-list-style=""bullet""><strong>Design Research for the Designer Maker (20 credits) </strong>This module addresses some of the research methods commonly used in three dimensional design. Typically the aim of 3D design research is to ask, observe, think and learn (with objectivity) from people who interact on a day to day basis with products, furniture and interior spaces. The module will involve you in a process of problem based learning; observing people to find out how ‘user types’ work with products, furniture and environments (user centred clinics) thus enlisting user participation in the design of three dimensional artefacts and spaces. With the user positioned at the heart of 3D design research, you will consider the materials and technologies that are appropriate to make objects and environments that more precisely fit the real needs of a user population.</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth=""1"" data-gc-list-style=""bullet""><strong>Specialist Projects 3D (40 credits) </strong>Students of design need to undertake assignments set in a variety of working situations in order for them to be able to work effectively as an individual with others and to develop knowledge and understanding of emerging technologies and practices in both interdisciplinary and specialist project contexts. In part 1 of the module you will choose from a selection of collaborative projects that calls upon you to problem solve using generic design skills in research, communication, concept development, negotiation and presentation. In part 2 of the module you will develop discipline specific skills embedded in a selection of a specialist project that helps you to focus and progress into year 2. As a furniture designer you will develop a specific knowledge and understanding of theory and practice in areas such as <em>human factors, ergonomics, contextual studies, user-populations, materials and processes</em>.</li>

							<h4>Modules</h4>
<p><strong>Compulsory modules:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Practising Responsible Business Behaviours</strong></p>
<p>This module examines the nature of business enterprise and its relationship with wider society, seeking answers to the question: what does it mean for businesses to behave responsibly? There is an ongoing debate regarding this question, with answers ranging from ‘just maximize shareholder value’ to ‘consider everyone who is affected, including unborn future generations’, with many variations in between. In this ongoing debate we encounter ideas regarding, for example, stakeholder theory, the triple bottom line, corporate social responsibility, business ethics, the role of the state or of supra-national organizations, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Principles of Applied Economics</strong></p>
<p>Develop your understanding of economic principles and learn to apply standard economic techniques. You will explore microeconomic and macroeconomic theories and how they affect business decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Decisions in Personal Financial Planning</strong></p>
<p>Understanding personal finances underpins the elementary skills for future career in financial industry. This module provides insight into concept of direct and indirect taxes and how they apply to individuals, for example inheritance tax, corporation tax and others. It also provides an in-depth understanding of secured and unsecured borrowing, credit cards and bank loans. Students will learn how to determine short and long-term financial goals and how to create a balanced plan to meet those goals. In addition, this module explores the key features of a range of personal financial products and services where students learn how to form appropriate financial recommendations for clients based on facts and data driven investigation. This module provides a detailed understanding of the main personal finance products such as Insurance, pensions, mortgages, savings, trusts and others. This module is essential for obtaining CISI qualification.</p>
<p><strong>Developing Analysis Techniques</strong></p>
<p>Mathematical and statistical skills are essential for various academic programmes. This module introduces essential quantitative methods for modelling and analysing financial data. In addition, statistics and probability concepts will be discussed and applied to various events. These theories will then be used to analyse practical situations and contribute to obtain necessary information for problem solving. This module feeds into level five - module “Applied Econometrics”.</p>
<p><strong>Bond and Equity Markets</strong></p>
<p>This module will provide students with an introduction to the essential concepts of finance and capital markets. Students will be able to describe the role of financial intermediaries within the economy as well as the functions they perform. Students will gain the skills essential for understanding and applying discounting techniques in different types of valuation models.

<p>All of our business students have the option of adding in a year in industry and / or a semester of studying abroad with one of our partners to their course. A year in industry gives students fantastic experience and is attractive to potential employers. This normally takes place after the second year of the course and extends the course duration by one year (15% of the standard tuition fee is chargeable). Study Abroad normally takes place for a semester of the second year of the course and doesn’t extend the course duration as credits achieved abroad count towards your degree.</p>
<p>You don’t need to decide whether you would like to take either of these options until after you have started the course with us.</p>

							<h3>Personal statement</h3>
<h4>Essential criteria</h4>
<p>As well as a strong standard of written English, we also look for the ability to demonstrate an interest and knowledge in the subject.  This can be done in a variety of ways, for example, evidence of exploring fine arts across a range of disciplines and media such as painting, drawing, sculpture, textiles and digital media.  An interest in the critical, historical and theoretical dimensions of the field is also important, with examples of this demonstrated through reading/writing reviews on exhibitions or visiting museums/galleries to view artwork from different time periods/movements.  In addition, candidates must show a commitment to the subject, though such things as extra-curricular museum visits, project work outside of any studies or related work experience.</p>
<h4>Valued criteria</h4>
<p>Candidates can demonstrate a real enthusiasm for the subject that goes beyond achieving good grades in exams.  Examples of this might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to express what inspires them to study art, such as particular exhibitions they may have seen or a certain artist’s work that they admire.</li>
<li>Demonstrating the ability to work collaboratively with peers for activities such as group projects at school or the Duke of Edinburgh Award.</li>
<li>The ability to talk about any future ambitions or career plans.</li>
</ul>

							<h3 class=""h-border"">Level 1</h3>
<p>Your first year of studying Fine Art BA (hons) aims to provide an induction to the processes, materials and practices of Fine Art. This will centre on experimental approaches to form and composition in 2D, 3D and 4D using analogue and digital techniques. Teaching will progress through drawing, painting, printmaking, sculpture, photography and 4D approaches such as performances and video giving you the opportunity to apply and understand your practice within these contexts. All through this process you will contextualise and critique your own work, the work of your peers and the work of professionals. You will understand the different situations, histories and contexts through which art is articulated.</p>
<p>Through this progressive development you will have an emerging sense of your personal “voice” as an artist. Alongside the studio modules, the Critical Contexts module provides foundational knowledge in the key theories and histories of Fine Art alongside other art forms. You will investigate topics and create essays and research projects which illuminate your understanding of these practices and contexts. Also within Critical Contexts, you will begin to construct a personal reflective portfolio in which you will consider all your work, both practical and theoretical, and consider the connections, meanings and implications of this work for your future practice. This portfolio will be regularly reviewed with your academic tutor and tutor group and you will start to make judgements about the future direction of your studies.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Critical Contexts 1:</strong> This module introduces you to the historical, social, political and material contexts that have informed the production and reception of creative practice. In so doing it draws attention to the different materials, technologies and cultural circumstances that have shaped the radical transformation of art, illustration and related practices. This material and historical foundation will enable you to grasp the complex array of forms that artistic practice can take, and the range of contexts in which it can be situated and applied. (20 credits)</li>
<li><strong><strong>Fine Art Fundamentals: </strong></strong>This module provides the key induction into the conceptual, technical and material practices of Fine Art. You will experiment, learn and apply technical skills that constitute fundamental principles and practices.  This will centre on drawing, painting, sculpture, printmaking and time based approaches to art making, using both traditional and digital tools. (40 credits)</li>
<li><strong>Critical Contexts 2:</strong> This module introduces you to the conceptual ideas and cultural politics that have informed the production and reception of creative practice. In so doing it draws attention to the different materials, technologies and cultural circumstances that have shaped the radical transformation of art, illustration and related practices. (20 credits)</li>
<li><strong><strong>Fine Art Explorations:</strong></strong> Fine Art Exploration enables you to achieve a deeper understanding of the diverse techniques and approaches to fine art practice by stimulating intellectual curiosity and building on the skills and knowledge gained in the previous module. Through a series of practice – led projects and workshops, you will develop further understanding of concepts and processes within 2D, 3D and 4D (time based) approaches to art making.

								<h3 class=""h-border"">Level 2</h3>
<p>Level 2 is intended to help you develop more detailed knowledge and understanding of Fine Art through theory and practice, building upon the work you have undertaken in Level 1. You will refine your practice in 2D, 3D or 4D works and apply your skills in constructing more complex works which critically engage audiences in a variety of professional contexts. These will be developed through tutor led projects, live projects with external partners and the opportunity to initiate and develop your own projects. Alongside the studio modules you will continue to build your skills and research and enquiry through the Critical Enquiry module which will enable you to learn diverse approaches to research and develop your own voice as a researcher.</p>
<p>You will also continue to develop and review your reflective portfolio making connections between theory, practice and also external professional practice, considering the impact of work related leaning options undertaken through the year. Students who wish to study away for a semester during Level 2 will undertake (at York St John University, in the semester preceding or following their time away) 20 credits of Critical Enquiry (1 or 2) which still provides a holistic overview of the learning through the level, including the experience of studying away, but appropriately adjusts the submission requirements accordingly. Students studying away will also normally only undertake either Fine Art Practice &amp; Development or Fine Art Exposition.</p>

Fieldwork is central to what we do and you will go on residential trips throughout every stage of your degree. Immerse yourself in our rugged Yorkshire landscape at places such as Brimham Rocks, Whitby and the North York Moors, as well as exploring the city of York from a geographical perspective. In your second and third years you will go further afield to investigate other environments and cultures. Our current overseas field trips include visits to Slovenia and Malta. These trips are integral to your learning, so they are covered within the cost of your degree, rather than being optional extras.</p>

							<p>We take you both out into the world and bring the world to you, with a series of guest lectures from professionals across various relevant sectors. These opportunities give you up-to-date, relevant insights into the changing world we are working in. Your practical and technical fieldwork skills will grow along with your theoretical knowledge. We will support you to become independent researchers and professionals, designing and carrying out your own research, generating your own knowledge and forming your own conclusions.</p>
<p>Geographers are very employable and this varied course, covering everything from ecosystems and river science to urban landscapes and citizenship, allows you to keep your career options open. Environmental management, conservation, tourism management and social policy are just some of the areas which will be open to you on graduation.</p>

							<h4>Modules</h4>
<p><strong>Compulsory modules:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Practising Responsible Business Behaviours: </strong>This module examines the nature of business enterprise and its relationship with wider society, seeking answers to the question: what does it mean for businesses to behave responsibly? There is an ongoing debate regarding this question, with answers ranging from ‘just maximize shareholder value’ to ‘consider everyone who is affected, including unborn future generations’, with many variations in between. In this ongoing debate we encounter ideas regarding, for example, stakeholder theory, the triple bottom line, corporate social responsibility, business ethics, the role of the state or of supra-national organisations, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Principles of Fashion Marketing: </strong>The module will introduce the students to the key elements of fashion marketing, and how the industry develops strategies in line with their target market. Consumer behaviour theories and their application in a fashion context will be explored. Students will develop a firm understanding of the differing product, pricing and distribution strategies required for mass versus luxury markets as well as the fragmented nature of promotion across these varied market segments.</p>
<p><strong>Fashion, Society &amp; Culture: </strong>The module will provide the students with an understanding of the evolution of fashion from a historical as well as a contemporary perspective. The impact of design, globalisation, technology, culture and people on lifestyle trends and fashion will be discussed and analysed. By identifying the key drivers of change in fashion, past and present, the students will develop a greater understanding of how these patterns of change could impact on the development of the industry in global markets in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Business analytics and the Blockchain: </strong>The aim of this module is to give you a practical grounding in the skills and techniques necessary to conduct data analytics and anticipate the effects of the blockchain on both short- and long-term strategy. The module introduces the blockchain and the scope of the blockchain industry. Basic statistical models are introduced in this module. As future business leaders, students will learn to understand blockchain, explore blockchain trends, investigate the market disruptions caused by technology and the impact of blockchain in industries worldwide. The module is designed to get you over the basic hurdles you will face when beginning to learn the data analytics and management techniques, and will cover some of the basic tasks that you face as a data analyst and will put you in a position to extend your knowledge of applying your analytical techniques.</p>
<p><strong>Product Development: Concept to Consumer: </strong>The module will introduce the students to the product development process in the fashion industry. The focus will be on the links between market needs and the stages involved in realising the product through to the consumer. The students will also gain a clear understanding of the cost issues that relate to new product development, developing innovations in textiles, designing and creating sustainable fashion product, the impact of globalisation and how digital and analytical tools are being developed to automate roles within the development process.</p>
<p><strong>Visual Fashion Communications: </strong>The module will be practice-based, developing skills to creatively communicate fashion concepts, products and promotions to both consumers and industry professionals, visually and verbally. Using industry-standard software, students will develop the core skills to create original promotions for platforms such as social media, retail environments or the web.</p>

								<h4>Modules</h4>
<p><strong>Compulsory modules:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Consumer Behaviour &amp; Consumer Trends: </strong>The module begins by introducing the students to the principles of consumer behaviour theories and how this translates through to consumer and organisational buyer behaviour. The focus will then move to the impact macro factors such as cultural and sociological shifts have on consumers and markets and how these offer insights that could inform future strategy. The students will understand how to identify these opportunities and translate them through to creative solutions to satisfy future needs in line with industry practice.</p>
<p><strong>International Fashion Branding: </strong>The module will explore the strategies employed by contemporary global fashion brands. Students will understand the role of branding within the fashion environment and the theories that are employed to create strong brands globally by utilising appropriate brand elements, marketing programmes and media channels to create awareness in globally diverse markets.</p>
<p><strong>Sourcing, Supply Chain, Ethics and Distribution: </strong>This module will address the future challenges facing fashion companies with their offshore sourcing and global supply chain management strategies. The digital revolution has had a dramatic impact on the flow of information throughout the supply chain, from inventory management to the need to effectively process big data. There is an increasing demand for more sustainable sources and the need to ‘green’ supply chain and logistical activities by developing environmental management systems. Increasing segmentation of the global market has resulted in a wide range of needs in outsourcing from the lean and agile requirements of the fast-fashion sector to the rapid growth of the luxury market. The module will prepare students for the industry by giving them a greater understanding of the increasing complexities of fashion retail supply chain.</p>
<p><strong>Research Methods for Service Industries: </strong>Organisations frequently require both an understanding of how and why data is acquired, and an ability to collect, analyse and interpret it. These skills are also important if students wish to progress to postgraduate study or careers in consultancy services. This module considers the use of quantitative and qualitative research methods in subject contexts, and allows students to develop skills in the collection, analysis and reporting of relevant data. In addition, this module will develop students’ project planning and management skills as a tool to manage the research process.</p>
<p><strong>Fashion Trends, Buying and Analytics: </strong>The aim of the module is to introduce the students to the buying process. The students will understand how fashion trends are identified and interpreted through to range planning in line with industry practice. Emerging technologies have seen the role of buying and distribution change significantly and the module will also look at how this has transformed the complexities of product category management and product development across mainstream and luxury markets in the fashion industry.</p>
<p><strong>Optional modules:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Professional Placement: </strong>The overarching rationale for this module is for students to begin to understand and begin planning towards their own personal transition from university into the workplace. The module will provide the student with a vocational opportunity aimed at enhancing their future work readiness. It is designed to develop skills, knowledge and understanding in a range of career-related personal, professional and key skill areas. The module specifically engages with issues such as career decision making, the recruitment cycle applying for jobs, sourcing and embarking on a placement or a group or individual project, CV writing and action planning.</p>
<p><strong>Business, Creativity and Opportunism Skills for the Workplace of Today: </strong>This module explores the fundamentals of entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship and the behaviour and skills required to 'think out of the box' to identify and pursue opportunities. You will establish what the behaviours and skills are of an entrepreneur, define creativity and innovation, as well as ask why they are so important to entrepreneurs. We will explore idea generation and evaluation techniques and learn how to recognise enterprise opportunities.</p>

								<h4>Modules</h4>
<p><strong>Compulsory Modules:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Research Investigation (40 credits): </strong>The aim of this module is to facilitate and express independent enquiry in a substantial piece of individual self-directed research work. This module provides students with the opportunity to plan and conduct a piece of research through individual and independent activity and to present their findings in using visual aids and in written academic format that meets professional standards. Students will develop research objectives, formulate appropriate methodologies, and apply problem solving and analytical skills in a business context of their choice. You will be able to choose between a traditional dissertation, an organisation-based project, a business research project and a business creation project.</p>
<p>Students have the opportunity to complete the investigation in the form of:</p>
<ul>
<li data-gc-list-depth=""1"" data-gc-list-style=""bullet"">Traditional dissertation</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth=""1"" data-gc-list-style=""bullet"">Research report</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth=""1"" data-gc-list-style=""bullet"">Consultancy project</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth=""1"" data-gc-list-style=""bullet"">Business creation project</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fashion Retail Strategy: </strong>The module will look at the complexities of fashion retail’s channel strategy. Understanding the emerging omni-channel consumer and their customer journey is becoming increasingly important. Fashion retailers need to coordinate their contact with consumers across a number of sales and communication platforms and ensure they work holistically together. In addition, creating content across a number of social media platforms tailored to differing markets is becoming increasingly challenging in such a fast paced, competitive industry. Taking this holistic view will prepare the students for these challenges.</p>
<p><strong>Fashion Communication &amp; New Media: </strong>The module will look at the theories to develop an integrated marketing communications plan to promote and communicate effectively to a selected fashion market. Students will develop critical research and analysis skills necessary to create an appropriate strategy. Emphasis will be placed on the growing significance of digital marketing and social media activities to create content.</p>
<p><strong>Fashion Career Planning &amp; Portfolio: </strong>The module will prepare the students for their future career goals. They will evaluate their skills and produce professional curriculum vitae, understand how to prepare for interviews and the application process. In addition, students will engage in extensive research into the careers market within their chosen field at a national and international level. The students will also create a strong exit portfolio of appropriate fashion outputs to offer a potential employer. Producing a strong digital CV and portfolio will also be required to enhance employability opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Managing Creativity &amp; Innovation in Fashion: </strong>The module will introduce the students to the concept of design management and the transformation of innovative ideas into fashion realities. Within many organisations there are cultural and knowledge gaps which hinder the realisation of design concepts despite continued pressure to deliver relevant innovations to an increasingly demanding market. Successful design management can transform the process. By adopting more effective communication methods in the decision making process across all departments, particularly between design and marketing disciplines, companies can become more effective at delivering relevant products and services in line with the demands of future fashion markets.</p>

						<div class=""col"">

							<p>This programme has been accredited by the Royal Geographical Society (with IBG) and focuses on urban, social, cultural and tourism geographies. York is a fascinating city with a thriving tourist industry, meaning it is an ideal location to study these exciting areas of geographical interest. You will get the opportunity to study a broad range of key geographical themes including landscape, place, spatial variation and inequality which are integrated throughout the programme.</p>
<p>On this course you won’t be confined to the classroom, from the start you'll actively engage with the environments and issues we investigate through fieldwork. You will be applying your knowledge to the real world across a variety of places, spaces and landscapes – from exploring the city on your doorstep to developing your own research on residential field trips in the UK and abroad. Field trips are great fun, but this real-world experience is also integral to your study, which is why the costs of participation are covered by your course fees. They allow you to develop a range of technical skills, deepen your understanding through first-hand experience and gain confidence in your abilities as an independent researcher.</p>

							

						</div>
						<div class=""col"">

							<p>The transferable skills that you will gain on this course will make you employable for positions in tourism management, heritage management, urban regeneration and many other sectors. You'll learn to analyse geographical data and critically interpret landscapes, as well designing and implementing your own research projects. You will also gain skills such as communication, team-working, problem-solving and time-management, which are applicable to an even wider range of careers.</p>

<p><strong>Updated information about  residential field trips</strong></p>
<p>From 2020 onwards we will be offering non-residential and/or virtual fieldwork as an alternative to residential field trips. This was developed in response to the travel restrictions and concerns caused by COVID19. For the 2020-21 academic year it is likely that all students will undertake this version of fieldwork in place of international work. While we hope to have all of our trips up and running again as soon as possible, non-residential and/or virtual fieldwork will continue to be available as an option in the future.</p>

							<h4><strong>Modules may include:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Writing the Media </strong>This module encourages you to explore and critically engage with a range of contemporary media debates and communications. The module is both exploratory and practical, using a range of current sources, structured exercises, hand-outs and discussion. Drawing upon this material you will explore media issues in relation to persuasion, tone of voice and dialogue. In doing so, you will analyse the ways in which media texts and images operate and start to question what they can learn from them. Through the investigation of these topics you will consider their own cultural practices and how they construct a sense of identity and give rise to certain meanings.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Perspectives </strong>The module aims to introduce the understanding that differing critical perspectives are possible in the consideration and analysis of any given media text or texts. You will explore the subject of ideology through the viewing practices and belief structures of media audiences. Through the study of media communication models and their history, and through engagement with the extensive body of media audience literature (primarily but certainly not exclusively relating to television audiences), you will explore the nature of contemporary mass communication.</p>
<p><strong>Media Research </strong>This module introduces you to experiences in higher education. It uses a variety of methods to engage you and to develop their your in research, referencing, critical thinking, academic writing, presentation skills and group work. Relevant examples of contemporary topics, themes and images will also be used to illustrate the importance of analysing the media. Overall this module provides a range of skills that will be essential to producing successful work as an undergraduate. A key element will be to encourage the idea that studying is fun as well as hard work.</p>
<p><strong>Media, Culture and Society </strong>This module aims to explore theories and concepts associated with analytical readings of the media. You will examine a variety of ‘texts’ to exemplify essential theoretical perspectives and will introduce key issues and debates relating to Media in social and cultural contexts. In addition, you will be introduced to key methodologies which will be of use throughout their degree and which can be adapted for a wide range of critical enquiry. The module will provide opportunities for you to assess and evaluate key modes of critical and analytical investigation.</p>
<p><strong>The Medium is the Message – Media Evolution and History </strong>The module will introduce you to the area of study known as ‘media ecology’ which encourages an understanding of a medium as anything in which meaning or communication of any sort talks place. Key thinkers in this field are most importantly Marshall McLuhan, Neil Postman, and Walter Ong amongst a number of others. The module will provide an introduction to the deep history of media and allied technologies (writing, printing, painting) and will examine how media, in the broadest of senses, determine the possibilities of communication, creative activity and understanding.</p>

								<h4><strong>Modules may include:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Convergence Cultures </strong>This module will introduce students to the theory and practice of convergence technology and with associated areas of transmedia activity and network theory. You will be encouraged to engage with the continuing development and evolution of communication technologies and the ways in which these can shape our everyday lives. The module will invite you to consider these developments in communications technology in relation to social, political and cultural factors and how these may affect the production and consumption of meaning and content.</p>
<p><strong>Issues of Taste </strong>This module aims to engage students in debates about the production, reception and contexts of media and cultural products which have produced controversy. It aims to analyse the debates about taste and the reception of text in a range of traditional, new and emergent media and to conduct this analysis using terms from aesthetics, from studies in contemporary media, and from the writings and records of those involved in critical debate and rereading. It will include concepts such as: propaganda, artistic licence, canonical status, acceptability, pornography, ‘harm’, censorship, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Popular Genres </strong>The purpose of this module is to explore the significance of popular genres within the fields of cultural production and to appreciate the histories and evolutions of popular genres as indicators of cultural change. The module also seeks to understand the possibilities for social, political and cultural exploration or critique offered through the study of popular genres and to encourage an understanding of popular genres within the context of media production and innovation.</p>
<p><strong>Visual Culture </strong>This module aims to acquaint you with critical debates in visual culture and allow you the opportunity to try out theoretical notions in a creative manner. They will be able to integrate material developed in previous and current modules which will provide a potential focus for the later stages of the programme. You will be able to understand the essential relationships between word and image from illustration to the internet. The module will investigate how visual strategies can be used to communicate complex ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Globalisation </strong>‘Globalisation’ is a fundamentally important term in understanding the processes of cultural, political and social change in the modern world. The role of the media in reacting to these processes through representation and articulation, and also in contributing to these changes, is inescapable. The aims of this module are to introduce you to the key theoretical debates and ideas which surround the contested notion of ‘globalisation’ and to examine the ways in which globalisation has been articulated and understood through media representation. The module will also examine the role of the media in reflecting and reacting to the processes of globalisation and its role in affecting emergent, resistant and dominant cultures.</p>
<p><strong>Media Enterprise </strong>The module examines some of the different processes required to produce a professional portfolio in the context of practical and vocational activities. The module aims to offer you the opportunity to engage with a more vocational element in the media and cultural context of their degree. You will work in groups to produce a portfolio which requires you to consider, amongst other things, marketing, advertising, business cases, product development and effective communication of ideas.</p>

							</div>
							<div class=""col"">

								<h4><strong>Modules may include:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Futures </strong>The module provides an advanced understanding of the ways in which new and emergent media, communications and other technologies shape our ways of living, acting and understanding the world and our place in it. You will build upon work undertaken in other modules which will enable a richer and more productive understanding into the development of various technologies and our relationship with them as well as recognising the profound global inequalities in the availability and importance of these. By considering the history of communications, media and other technologies you will be better able to appreciate how these affect, contribute to and challenge our notions of human philosophy, ethics, morals and meaning as well as how developments in convergent technology might influence aesthetic activity in its production, consumption and cultural value.</p>
<p><strong>Media Geographies </strong>The module aims to further explore and develop the concepts and issues of globalisation, localisation, regionalism and national identity in relation to city cultures. The module will draw upon the media and cultural studies area of ‘urban studies’ in order to consider the representations, symbolic and social structures, development, uses and experiences of the modern and contemporary city. You will be encouraged to engage in experiential exploration of contemporary cities and identify their historical traces. Alongside this, you will consider technological advances and futuristic narratives of the city.</p>
<p><strong>Special Study </strong>This module aims to encourage students registered for a Joint Award to become independent learners through an extended piece of work which should demonstrate the ability to offer a sustained critical and analytical examination of a student’s chosen, relevant topic and a similar engagement with the literature available on their chosen topic. This module offers the student the opportunity to integrate and develop aspects of the taught components of their programme and to provide a context for the selection, application and exploration of relevant analytical techniques</p>

Through the study of media communication models and their history, and through engagement with the extensive body of media audience literature (primarily but certainly not exclusively relating to television audiences), you will explore the nature of contemporary mass communication. </p>
<p><strong>Media Research</strong><br>This module introduces you to experiences in higher education. It uses a variety of methods to engage you and to develop their your in research, referencing, critical thinking, academic writing, presentation skills and group work.  Relevant examples of contemporary topics, themes and images will also be used to illustrate the importance of analysing the media. Overall this module provides a range of skills that will be essential to producing successful work as an undergraduate. A key element will be to encourage the idea that studying is fun as well as hard work. </p>
<p><strong>Media, Culture and Society</strong><br>This module aims to explore theories and concepts associated with analytical readings of the media. You will examine a variety of ‘texts’ to exemplify essential theoretical perspectives and will introduce key issues and debates relating to Media in social and cultural contexts. In addition, you will be introduced to key methodologies which will be of use throughout their degree and which can be adapted for a wide range of critical enquiry. The module will provide opportunities for you to assess and evaluate key modes of critical and analytical investigation. </p>
<p><strong>The Medium is the Message – Media Evolution and History</strong><br>The module will introduce you to the area of study known as ‘media ecology’ which encourages an understanding of a medium as anything in which meaning or communication of any sort talks place. Key thinkers in this field are most importantly Marshall McLuhan, Neil Postman, and Walter Ong amongst a number of others. The module will provide an introduction to the deep history of media and allied technologies (writing, printing, painting) and will examine how media, in the broadest of senses, determine the possibilities of communication, creative activity and understanding.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Literature modules include:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction to Literary Studies I</strong><strong><br></strong>In this module you will have the chance to build your confidence in working with literature at degree level. You will engage with a range of texts written prior to the nineteenth century that includes prose, drama, poetry, speeches, letters and articles. Together, we will start to think about some of the ways that literature and history can be brought together and why the study of English Literature remains a popular and important discipline.</p>
<p> <strong>Writing, Research and Literature</strong><strong><br></strong>On this module you will learn the basics of academic writing and research at University level. Drawing upon a range of classic and contemporary short stories and poems as your starting point, you will develop a range of skills such as, using the library catalogue, choosing secondary sources, planning essays, developing arguments, and close reading texts, so that you can write and discuss the works that inspire you with confidence and flair.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction to Literary Studies II</strong><strong><br></strong>On this module we’ll examine some well-known classics alongside more unusual selections that help us to question the social, political, cultural and historical values by which we approach literature. This includes an exciting range of texts across different media and forms, from nineteenth century poetry to early cinema and 1930s nonfiction. Along the way we’ll be thinking about gender, class, war, empire, form, genre, and much more besides.</p>
<p><strong>Theorising Literature: Power and Identity</strong><strong><br></strong>The critic Michel Foucault once wrote that ‘power is everywhere’; on this module we seek to uncover the ways that economic, social, and cultural power is portrayed and exerted through the written word. Who has the power in a literary text? And how do we as readers discern this? We will discuss these issues as they relate to identity politics and the intersections between class, gender, race, sexuality, ability, nation, and age in selected literary works.</p>
<p><strong>Canonicity</strong><strong><br></strong>This module prepares students to reflect on the study of Literature at undergraduate level by introducing them to two key, overarching concepts: the idea of literary value and the canon. The module is designed to complement semester 1 modules in which issues of literary value and the canon are raised, albeit in less detail, and to provide a meta-context for students to learn and reflect on <em>why</em> they study <em>what</em> they study at university as well as, more precisely, how canonical assumptions can influence their reading and writing. </p>

								<p>In the second year you are given the opportunity to develop your communication skills using visual media and design packages with the help of a professional graphic designer. This level also involves an employability and enterprise element which further cultivates transferable skills.</p>

							</div>
							<div class=""col"">

								<p><strong>Media modules include:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Convergence Cultures</strong><br>This module will introduce students to the theory and practice of convergence technology and with associated areas of transmedia activity and network theory. You will be encouraged to engage with the continuing development and evolution of communication technologies and the ways in which these can shape our everyday lives. The module will invite you to consider these developments in communications technology in relation to social, political and cultural factors and how these may affect the production and consumption of meaning and content. </p>
<p><strong>Issues of Taste</strong><br>This module aims to engage students in debates about the production, reception and contexts of media and cultural products which have produced controversy. It aims to analyse the debates about taste and the reception of text in a range of traditional, new and emergent media and to conduct this analysis using terms from aesthetics, from studies in contemporary media, and from the writings and records of those involved in critical debate and rereading. It will include concepts such as:  propaganda, artistic licence, canonical status, acceptability, pornography, ‘harm’, censorship, etc. </p>
<p><strong>Popular Genres</strong><br>The purpose of this module is to explore the significance of popular genres within the fields of cultural production and to appreciate the histories and evolutions of popular genres as indicators of cultural change. The module also seeks to understand the possibilities for social, political and cultural exploration or critique offered through the study of popular genres and to encourage an understanding of popular genres within the context of media production and innovation.</p>
<p><strong>Visual Culture</strong><br>This module aims to acquaint you with critical debates in visual culture and allow you the opportunity to try out theoretical notions in a creative manner. They will be able to integrate material developed in previous and current modules which will provide a potential focus for the later stages of the programme. You will be able to understand the essential relationships between word and image from illustration to the internet. The module will investigate how visual strategies can be used to communicate complex ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Globalisation</strong><br>‘Globalisation’ is a fundamentally important term in understanding the processes of cultural, political and social change in the modern world. The role of the media in reacting to these processes through representation and articulation, and also in contributing to these changes, is inescapable. The aims of this module are to introduce you to the key theoretical debates and ideas which surround the contested notion of ‘globalisation’ and to examine the ways in which globalisation has been articulated and understood through media representation. The module will also examine the role of the media in reflecting and reacting to the processes of globalisation and its role in affecting emergent, resistant and dominant cultures. </p>
<p><strong>Media Enterprise</strong><br>The module examines some of the different processes required to produce a professional portfolio in the context of practical and vocational activities. The module aims to offer you the opportunity to engage with a more vocational element in the media and cultural context of their degree. You will work in groups to produce a portfolio which requires you to consider, amongst other things, marketing, advertising, business cases, product development and effective communication of ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Literature modules include:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Literary Theory</strong><strong><br></strong>Is it proper to remove literary texts from their historical contexts, or is historical awareness essential to any understanding of the text? Is it really the case that a text can mean anything to anybody, or are there more objective ways of understanding what texts are and how they work? What is actually happening when we read literature? And what is ‘literature’ anyway? This module will engage with the fundamental questions lying behind the discipline of literary studies. </p>
<p><strong>Mapping America</strong><strong><br></strong>This module introduces students to the relationship between American literature and physical and mythical/symbolic spaces, and explores the ways in which this space is imagined and represented in a range of texts. The rationale behind this module is to ask students to think creatively, critically, and innovatively about physical space and literature, and explore the relationship between American socio-economic history, and the development of a specifically American literary tradition.</p>
<p><strong>Conflicting Words</strong><strong><br></strong>This module provides an opportunity to read texts produced by and written about major conflicts of the twentieth and early twenty first centuries. We will start with the mechanised horror of the Western Front and work our way through the Second World War, the Spanish Civil War, Vietnam, the Troubles, 9/11 and the War on Terror. We read texts by writers as diverse as Martha Gellhorn, George Orwell and Kurt Vonnegut and examine the complex relationship between language, experience and memory.</p>
<p><strong>Sick Novels: Literature and Disease</strong><strong><br></strong>On this module we’ll be looking at the ways in which diseases are represented in novels from several different periods. What sorts of things can disease suggest in the literary text, and what kinds of associations come with different diseases? Why do some diseases seem to appear in many novels (tuberculosis and cancer, for example) and why are some less often written about? What kinds of anxieties about society do diseases embody or allow the author to explore?</p>
<p><strong>Shakespeare: Perspectives</strong><strong><br></strong>This is an exciting module which will explore Shakespeare’s plays in their early modern contexts but also understand them as written for performance. We will also explore them as modern/post-modern texts in reception. The module engages with a range of theoretical approaches, from new historicist to feminist and queer readings. </p>
<p><strong>From Harlem to Hip-Hop: African American Literature and Culture</strong><strong><br></strong>Without doubt, the African American experience is a major influence on our contemporary political, cultural, and social landscape. Starting with the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s and continuing through to the present day, we will discuss key African American novels, plays, and poems alongside music (including jazz, soul, blues, and hip-hop), film, art, and political writings in order to better understand the ways that black writers respond to and shape American culture and history.</p>
<p><strong>Civil War to Civil Society: British Literature, 1640-1740</strong><strong><br></strong>The English Civil War and execution of Charles I, the Commonwealth, the ‘Glorious Revolution’, and the Restoration of the Crown led to a period of great literary production – as well as suspicion from those in power towards writers and publishers. This module will engage with the ways in which literature challenged and negotiated what it meant to be ‘civil’ in the 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup>centuries. </p>
<p><strong>Adaptations</strong><strong><br></strong>We look at the different ways books and films tell stories, and what happens to literature and literary characters when they get ‘translated’ onto the screen. In addition to examining specific examples of film adaptation, students can choose to experiment creatively on a project of their own.</p>
<p><strong>Literature at Work</strong><strong><br></strong>This module will enable English Literature students to engage in discussions about a range of career trajectories relevant to their degree on both a practical and ideological level. Crucially, the module will facilitate reflective thinking about skillsets and their relationship to students’ career aims. Team work and project management are integral features, with students working in groups to develop, plan, and execute a project or alternatively, to engage in work-place learning through an external placement. Guest speakers will introduce a variety of graduate career pathways, potentially including publishing, research, teaching, marketing, and journalism.</p>
<p><strong>Revolution and Response: British Literature, 1740-1840</strong><strong><br></strong>Beginning with the ‘rise of sensibility’, this module will explore the idea of ‘revolution’ and the myriad ways in which the literature published in these decades agitated for and responded to political upheavals and changes as well as ‘revolutions’ in literary tastes and production, gender roles and expectations, the role of literature, and the relationship between individuals and society. This module will engage with the idea of ‘revolution’ through a wide range of topics and texts, including poetry, prose, and drama. </p>

<p><strong>Authoritarianism</strong><br>The module examines the persistence of authoritarian rule in the 21st century. Students will study the characteristics of authoritarian systems, the structures, actors and actions that foster and maintain them, the place of authoritarian systems in international politics, and examine the relationships with totalitarianism and democracy. Case studies will be used to illustrate and analyse theoretical and conceptual approaches to authoritarianism.</p>
<p><strong>Global Governance</strong><br>The module explores in detail the institutions, structures and processes of global governance. In particular it focuses on the institutions of the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, regional organisations such as the European Union, and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations. Global issues will be examined to analyse the work of these institutions, which may include: human rights, international terrorism, global inequality, the environment, conflict and peace.</p>
<p><strong>Politics of the Environment</strong><br>The module examines the nature and causes of environmental problems, and the political response to these. In the continuing context of global climate change, the focus is placed on the international system as a means to address environmental problems, and the level of success in doing so.

</ul>
<ul>
<li data-gc-list-depth=""1"" data-gc-list-style=""bullet""><strong>Design Research for the Designer Maker (20 credits) </strong>This module addresses some of the research methods commonly used in three dimensional design. Typically the aim of 3D design research is to ask, observe, think and learn (with objectivity) from people who interact on a day to day basis with products, furniture and interior spaces. The module will involve you in a process of problem based learning; observing people to find out how ‘user types’ work with products, furniture and environments (user centred clinics) thus enlisting user participation in the design of three dimensional artefacts and spaces. With the user positioned at the heart of 3D design research, you will consider the materials and technologies that are appropriate to make objects and environments that more precisely fit the real needs of a user population.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li data-gc-list-depth=""1"" data-gc-list-style=""bullet""><strong>Specialist Projects 3D (40 credits) </strong>Students of design need to undertake assignments set in a variety of working situations in order for them to be able to work effectively as an individual with others and to develop knowledge and understanding of emerging technologies and practices in both interdisciplinary and specialist project contexts. In part 1 of the module you will choose from a selection of collaborative projects that calls upon you to problem solve using generic design skills in research, communication, concept development, negotiation and presentation. In part 2 of the module you will develop discipline specific skills embedded in a selection of a specialist project that helps you to focus and progress into year 2. As a product designer you will develop a specific knowledge and understanding of theory and practice in areas such as <em>human factors, ergonomics, contextual studies, user-populations, materials and processes</em>.</li>

You will develop the analytical and critical skills associated with Computer Aided Design (CAD) software necessary to match the specific needs in the creative industries. You will also develop an awareness of ‘cross platform’ digital applications, enabling you to utilise these more effectively when working collaboratively or through interdisciplinary contexts. The module will extend your knowledge about technical processes, including demonstrating the advantages of the different systems from rapid prototyping including areas such as stereo-lithography, laser cutting, and 3D printing. This will enable you to confidently articulate your work and to experiment with a range of digital tools to achieve real and virtual outputs.</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth=""1"" data-gc-list-style=""bullet""><strong>Specialist Studio Practice:Product Design (60 credits) </strong>This module offers you the opportunity to undertake a variety of specialised design work. You will identify design problems, write a design brief, plan for and execute a range of work that is based on research into the sector or topic of choice. This is delivered through a series of projects, including tutor led, client and competition projects. Alternatively you may propose self-generated design briefs. This module is an ideal vehicle for you to practice and apply your developing skills to construct a portfolio of design work that articulates both technical competences and your own developing ‘voice’ in product design. These will form an evolving practice in 3D and product design studying the following; an <em>advanced knowledge of materials, processes and technologies, design for craft based, batch and industrial production, ergonomic modelling, product testing and evaluation and CAD-CAM.</em></li>
<li data-gc-list-depth=""1"" data-gc-list-style=""bullet""><strong>Specialist Studio Practice: Product Design (Student Exchange) (40 Credits) </strong>Students, who are wishing to study abroad with our International partners during semester 2, will need to undertake this optional module during semester 1 of year 2.

<li data-gc-list-depth=""1"" data-gc-list-style=""bullet""><strong>Professional Portfolio (20 credits) </strong>It is important that students gain some experience of professional practice in industry and commerce particularly as many are ambitious at graduation to start their professional careers in a freelance capacity. The module offers ‘preparation’ and ‘practice’ for a period of work-related learning through the development of a student CV, letter of application, interview techniques and planning. Visiting speakers from a variety of disciplines will be invited to inform you of real world scenarios. Additionally, you will undertake ‘work based learning’ either through a client project or within an appropriate design related environment. Both the ‘Careers Department’ and programme tutors will support you to secure an appropriate work related learning placement.</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth=""1"" data-gc-list-style=""bullet""><strong>Collaborative Project (20 credits) </strong>This module will be structured as an intensive collaborative group project requiring you to collaborate across the specialist design awards and also with external “clients” to resolve complex social, spatial, economic or cultural problems through design. Drawing on models such as service and systems design thinking, you will engage in live collaborative research and problem solving, presenting your solutions in an exhibition context. This will enable you to understand the possibilities of interdisciplinary practice, through a range of real and virtual processes. This will provide you with fundamental practical and interpersonal skills referenced to in professional industry practices.</li>

<li data-gc-list-depth=""1"" data-gc-list-style=""bullet""><strong>Design Research and Innovation Proposal (20 credits) </strong>The Design Research and Innovation Proposals module (DRIP) supports the programme aim and aspirations for emerging design graduates to produce ‘new and unexpected outcomes’ leading to various forms and levels of innovation. Innovative design in a contemporary society requires thinking design practitioners who are able to understand the theoretical, cultural and social structures which underpin design problems and their potential solutions. This module aims to enable this level of thinking for you as a graduating design student.</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth=""1"" data-gc-list-style=""bullet""><strong>Major Project (60 credits) </strong>The aim of this module is to enable you as a product designer to execute your graduate design brief. The brief will be researched, proposed, argued and planned for in the adjacent module- Design, Research &amp; Innovation Proposal(s). You are tasked to demonstrate that you are capable of applying design skills to identify and overcome problems, present a critical argument to support decision making and apply reasoning and practical skills in order to offer creative and technical solutions to the problem(s). You will aim to make work that contributes toward and embeds discipline based debate in the contemporary cultural and technological context. The module is a frame work that enables you to demonstrate your graduate skills as a designer and to focus on your plans for continuing professional development. You will be encouraged to engage in designing for the following areas of professional practices such as product design, furniture, homeware, CAD, electrical goods and consumer durables.</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth=""1"" data-gc-list-style=""bullet""><strong>Client Project: Product Design (40 credits) </strong>This module enables you to build competences with and produce work that addresses the needs and requirements of clients, competitions and user groups. The context and detailed requirements of the client centred design brief will be established in the adjacent module - Design Research and Innovation Proposal. Work in this, the Client Project module, will therefore extend and address the developmental, technical and presentational design resolution aspects of the client-centred design brief. Therefore you will be expected to research and negotiate a product design brief with a client and in so doing establish your credentials as an autonomous independent practitioner. The programme is well connected to a variety of designers and studios around the local and national region, providing you with the opportunities to engage with projects that have ‘real world’ experiences. You will engage in ‘live’ project(s) in liaison with our industry partners helping to prepare you in a broad range of design practices for further employment opportunities.</li>

<li data-gc-list-depth=""1"" data-gc-list-style=""bullet"">Talk to a range of staff in the school about their roles, for example, classroom teachers, subject leaders, pastoral leaders, teaching assistants, SENCO, data/assessment leader. However, please remember that they are busy people and ask them for a time it might be more appropriate to meet/talk.</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth=""1"" data-gc-list-style=""bullet"">Talk with pupils about their work and the progress they are making. Look at how their work is marked/assessed and how pupils are encouraged to respond to this.</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth=""1"" data-gc-list-style=""bullet"">If appropriate, become involved with wider aspects of the school, for example, accompany staff on break duties, support with after school clubs and extra-curricular activities.</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth=""1"" data-gc-list-style=""bullet"">Try to look at a range of school policies, for example, on rewards and sanctions, teaching and learning.</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth=""1"" data-gc-list-style=""bullet"">Keep notes, especially of resources, activities and strategies which work well.</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth=""1"" data-gc-list-style=""bullet"">Reflect on each day and consider what you have learnt/observed (both positive and negative aspects) and consider how this might affect you as a classroom teacher, in the future.</li>

							<p>We work closely with partnership school colleagues to support you in developing your professional practice, providing you with excellent opportunities to engage in wider professional issues relating to pedagogy and the curriculum. </p>
<p>You will choose to specialise in either a lower primary or an upper primary route. The lower primary route covers the 3-7 age range and you will have assessed placements in both Early Years Foundation Stage and Key Stage 1. The upper primary route covers the 7-11 age range and you will have assessed placements in both lower Key Stage 2 (year 3 or 4) and upper Key Stage 2 (year 5 or 6). Whichever route you choose to specialise in you will be qualified for the whole 3-11 age range on successful completion of the course.</p>
<p>You will be expected to critically engage with educational issues and develop as reflective practitioners, able to evaluate and adapt your practice to meet the needs of learners from diverse cultural backgrounds. The University provides a strong centre-based opportunity to develop and share good practice.</p>
<p>Your professional development will be underpinned throughout the course by essential theoretical knowledge. You will assess current research and developments at local, national and international levels, critically engaging with the educational issues which will shape your teaching practice.</p>
						</div>
						<div class=""col"">                      
							<p>You will gain a thorough understanding of the current primary and early years curriculum, including core and foundation subjects. We emphasise the importance of meeting the individual needs of children from diverse backgrounds. This includes learning about the impact of ethnicity, the challenges raised by teaching those with English as an Additional Language (EAL) and the needs of children with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEN/D).</p>
<p>The PGCE Primary programme is structured in phases (introductory, developmental and consolidation). Each phase builds upon the last to enable you to reflect upon your learning and make effective links with curriculum and pedagogy through relating theory to practice.</p>
<p>Unlike the school-centred route, you can also study for your University centred PGCE on a part time basis. This makes the course more accessible if you have care responsibilities or want to work while you study. It also allows more time for reflection and the development of key skills. The part time course runs over two academic years. You will work alongside the students on the full time PGCE course. You will access the same taught sessions and opportunities.</p>

							<p class=""lede"">A rich understanding of political theory will enable you to analyse, challenge and address the unique political issues of the world today – but it is through an understanding of philosophy and ethics that you can balance questions of social good and global justice. If politics is your map to a changing political landscape then philosophy and ethics are your compass. This Politics, Philosophy &amp; Ethics Degree will develop you as a resilient and insightful thinker and an active citizen, prepared for a range of careers.</p>

							

						</div>
						<div class=""col"">

							<p>Drawing upon historical and contemporary thinkers, this course explores the trajectory of political thought, tackling questions which have troubled mankind throughout time. Why should we obey the state? What is ‘good government’? How do we understand equality and what makes for a just society? Through an investigation of these questions you will consider the social and historical context, impact and legacy of key thinkers and ideological movements.</p>
<p>We also encourage you to explore topics of personal interest and to look beyond standard practice and simple answers; how have philosophers understood a controversial idea like forgiveness, or a complex emotion like compassion? How might watching films be a way of exploring ethical problems?</p>
<p>Philosophers have played an influential role in the development of political and ethical thought throughout history. This course will introduce you to some of the most important topics in these areas and give you a full understanding of their interaction historically and in contemporary contexts. Through this application to everyday concerns, philosophy will come to life. No longer just as an intriguing intellectual pursuit, philosophy becomes a way of engaging with the world around us and the problems it presents us with.</p>

<p>Using a range of qualitative and quantitative approaches, my research examines the role of media, social media and technology in the lives of adolescents and young adults. More specifically, I examine how media and technology are involved in the transmission of dominant appearance and body-related messages and the impact of such messages on body image, body-shaping behaviour (such as diet and exercise) and mental health.</p>
<p>I am interested in supervising quantitative or qualitative projects aligned with my research expertise. In particular, I would welcome the opportunity to supervise examinations of the role of diet and exercise mobile phone apps (e.g., MyFitnessPal) and /or social media messages (e.g. #fitspiration) in the aetiology of negative outcomes such as self-objectification, body image concerns, negative thought patterns and/or maladaptive exercise and eating behaviours.</p></accordion> <accordion name=""Pain management and virtual reality""><div class=""cols"">

<p>Clinical trials have demonstrated that immersing individuals in virtual worlds can help manage a wide range of situations where some degree of pain or discomfort is normally experienced (from changing bandages on wounds to pain during childbirth). Since 2017, the literature base has expanded rapidly with beneficial effects of VR distraction being demonstrated across a rapidly growing number of labs across the world, with a wide range of clinical populations, and many different forms of pain. However, the theoretical basis of this effect, and the conditions under which it works best, have been relatively neglected within this rapid expansion of the literature. It is generally hypothesised that any effect occurs because virtual reality experiences recruit attentional resources that might otherwise be allocated to other stimuli, although some theorists have more recently argued that the degree of ‘presence’ an individual feels in the virtual world may also be important. Projects in this area will make use of a cold pressor test (as a source of pain/discomfort), and the latest VR headsets, to further develop our theoretical understanding of how the effect works, and the conditions under which it works best.</p></accordion> <accordion name=""Children’s problem solving and tool innovation""><div class=""cols"">

<p>We all know that children are brilliant at learning to use tools. By copying others, children quickly master how to use a spoon, a cup and even an iPad. In contrast to children’s ability to learn from others, children are surprisingly poor at working things out for themselves. My research investigates the difficulties children have with innovating simple novel tools to solve problems. The evolution of human culture (tools in particular) is due to our faithful imitation of others actions, and innovations. Much research has focused on our ability to replicate what we see, but much less is known about innovations. My research focuses on why innovation is so difficult and what makes someone an innovator. I am interested in supervising projects aligned with the following topics:</p>

<p>Children with Autism have been found to have significantly lower scores on theory of mind (ToM) tasks when compared to typically developing children. They have also been found to have less imaginative play episodes. Recent research has found that although children with Autism show less imagination behaviour, in terms of having an imaginary companion (IC), their ICs are qualitatively similar to children who are typically developing. These data bring up a new research question as typically developing children with ICs have been found to have more developed ToM than those children without ICs. Note, potential students must have access to children with autism in order to do this project.</p></accordion> <accordion name=""Truth and morality in Brexit discourse""><div class=""cols"">

<p>A contemporary view on political discourse – something often dubbed as “post-truth politics” – is that there has been a lamentable decline in truth in how politicians talk today. This is a view I have taken issue within my past work. Instead I argue that ‘truth’ and ‘fact’ are not a simple reflection of objective reality, but, instead, are rhetorical tools in political argumentation. That is, seemingly objective facts are used to subjective ends. From this perspective, we are not in an era where truth no longer matters. Instead truth is a rhetorical resource. To this end, I am interested in studying how politicians use facts as rhetorical resources. My past work has looked at this, and I am now interested in studying how truth and morality intersect in political argumentation. Put crudely, how do facts and ideology intermingle in discourse?</p>
<p>I am currently overseeing the development of a database of political discourse, with the intent that in the future it will become publicly available. This project involves drawing on and building this database, with the above research theme in mind. Analysis of the data will draw on discursive psychology and rhetorical psychology. While the aim is a focus on truth and morality in political discourse, discursive psychology is a data-driven analytical approach and there is room for other avenues of research if the data supports this.</p></accordion> <accordion name=""Intra-sexual competition: sexual scripts, promiscuity, and gossip""><div class=""cols"">

<p>Based on differential obligate parental investment, men and women have different optimum mating strategies. Where gender ratios are skewed, or where access to potential mates is restricted, competition for mating opportunities occurs. Research suggests that this leads to female-female competition in the form of gossip aimed at limiting sexual behaviours of rivals and, where promiscuity is detected, reduced intrasexual cooperation. Specifically, evidence suggests that women spread gossip more frequently than men (Davis, Dufort, Desrochers, &amp; Vaillancourt, 2018), they are more likely to punish women who exhibit sexual-accessibility signals (Muggleton, Tarran, &amp; Fincher, 2019), and such in/direct opposition is more likely in individuals who perceive women as more economically dependent (Price, Pound &amp; Scott, 2014). This relates to my own research and projects I am supervising that focus on the underlying factors that affect (primarily negative) interpersonal interactions (e.g. sexual assault). I have expertise in experimental and survey research methods and would be interested in supervising quantitative projects aligned with the following topics:</p>

<p>My expertise is in experimental research in the domains of language and memory, using both behavioural methods and physiological measures such as electroencephalography (EEG). My interests are in cognitive aspects of reading and verbal short-term memory, both in 'normal' and language-impaired populations (e.g., dyslexia). My recent research has focused on influences of semantic properties (by manipulating word meaning) on phonological measures in different contexts. I’m interested in supervising quantitative projects addressing similar questions and building on this work.</p>
<p>I am particularly interested in (i) experimental projects investigating semantic influences on word-level processing (especially, but not exclusively, if applied to developmental dyslexia); or (ii) projects that make use of event-related potentials (ERPs; making use of our EEG facilities) to explore questions related to the time course of semantic/ phonological/other cognitive effects during language tasks. (Note that ERP projects are generally demanding from conception through to completion and would require careful development in discussion with me). I would be happy to hear from potential students with related interests and project ideas.</p></accordion> <accordion name=""The psychology of elite athlete expertise and performance""><div class=""cols"">

<p>An extraordinary physiological capacity combined with personal characteristics and cognitive functioning are crucial for high performance in sports. Despite wide-spread attention there is still much to understand regarding elite performance in sport. My research focuses on three areas of sport and exercise psychology, namely, executive function, personality, and psychometrics. All three intersect across athletic expertise and the individual differences associated with elite athletes. Specifically, I am interested in the mechanics driving athlete expertise and performance. In that, my work looks at a range factors across different methodologies. For example, my previous research has explored the effect of Dark personality traits (e.g., narcissism, Machiavellianism and psychopathy) on health-related outcomes such as physical activity, whether expert decision-making interacts with emotional competency to predict sport related outcomes such as risk-taking, and whether self-report questionnaires capturing personal dispositions such as mental toughness successfully differentiate individuals across athlete expertise. I am interested in supervising projects in the following areas:</p>

<p>Through childhood and adolescence, young people develop an increasingly sophisticated ability to understand, infer and reason about mental states (i.e. the thoughts, beliefs and feelings of themselves and others). This ‘theory of mind’ is central to social functioning and is known to develop differently in young people on the autism spectrum. Recent research has begin to examine how explicit theory of mind might develop through processes of social transmission; for example, children can learn about how people’s mental states relate to behaviour through exposure to stories. Storybooks contain more complex references to mental states than everyday conversation and, in order to understand the behaviour of characters in books, readers have to reason about their thoughts, beliefs and feelings. I am interested in supervising quantitative or mixed methods projects aligned with the following topics:</p>

<p>In psychology, experiments are the tool of choice for generating data, testing hypotheses, and observing causal relationships between psychological variables. Experimental control techniques are key to ensuring the internal validity of the research design. However, standardised and artificial experimental tasks have been seen as a threat to a study’s ecological validity; that is, the degree to which the results generated in the experimental setting are similar to results obtained in a naturalistic setting. For instance, reviewing experimental research on cognitive processes in decision making, Tetlock (1985) pointed out a key feature of decision making presumably missing from laboratory research: the accountability of participants’ judgments and behaviours. Instead of dismissing laboratory research for its inadequacy in reproducing other settings, it might be worthwhile to open the “black box” of psychological experiments in order to better understand how this environment shapes participants’ behaviour. Taking a reflexive approach, this project seeks to uncover the organisation of experimental settings. Students will have the option to either (1) record an experiment that is being conducted at YSJ or (2) work on an existing corpus of video recordings of a psychological experiment on impression formation. They will transcribe the data and analyse an interactional phenomenon that they identify in the data. The following are examples of research questions that could be pursued:</p>

You will have the chance to focus your studies on an area of policing you are particularly interested in as part of your final year through the Evidence-based Policing project. The delivery and assessment of the programme will be based around developing skills that are directly related to the role of a police officer.</p>
<p>Our Degree in Professional Policing programme is specifically designed for people wishing to join the police service in England and Wales. Before applying we advise that you check your eligibility to become a police constable. If you are unlikely to meet the required criteria to apply to the Police Service then this course will not be appropriate for you, visit the College of Policing website to find out more about entry requirements. </p>
<p>Successful completion of the programme does not guarantee a position as a police constable. All persons wishing to join the police service will have to go through the application process, the College of Policing’s national assessment centre and meet any other requirements set by individual police forces. </p>

							<h4>Modules include:</h4>
<p><strong>Studying Religion (20 credits)<br></strong>This module introduces you to the academic study of religion. It will introduce basic terms, methodologies and issues in the study of religion in preparation for your degree programme.</p>
<p><strong>Values &amp; Virtues (20 credits)<br></strong>This module examines key concepts and theories within both religious and secular ethical discourses, and applies them to contexts, such as famine and affluence. You will explore questions such as ‘what informs the ethical decisions people make’; ‘on what do people base their attitudes to moral dilemmas’; ‘are there sources for moral reasoning other than religious ones’; ‘what, if anything, do rich nations owe poorer nations’?</p>
<p><strong>Philosophy &amp; Religion (20 credits)<br></strong>The module will take you through important debates in the philosophy of religion, from the classic to the contemporary. You will gain a critical understanding of religion as a pervasive aspect of human society, as well as challenging preconceived ideas and learning how to construct rational arguments.</p>
<p><strong>World Christianity (20 credits)<br></strong>This module introduces the story of Christianity. Students will consider the religion’s global spread, considering its interaction with diverse cultural, political and social contexts. The aim is to enable an understanding of Christianity today, the nature and impact of secularisation and areas of growth and decline.</p>
<p><strong>Global Islam (20 credits)<br></strong>Islam is a much discussed topic, but often people misunderstand and misrepresent this diverse tradition. We will cover the basic beliefs and practices followed by the majority of Muslims across the globe as well as exploring some of the different groups who call themselves Muslim. The experience of Muslims in the UK will be unpacked from a religious, social and political perspective.</p>

								<h4>Modules include:</h4>
<p><strong>From Descartes to Marx – Philosophers &amp; Religion (20 credits)<br></strong>This module focuses on modern western philosophy, and aims to cover in some detail key philosophers from the beginning of the 17th century through to the end of the 19th century, as well as the ethical and religious issues that emerge from their thought.</p>
<p><strong>Engaging with Philosophical Texts (20 credits)<br></strong>Students will engage with selected philosophical texts thoroughly, critically and imaginatively. Texts will be explored alongside the development of a critical understanding of their cultural, religious and political contexts, so as to give students a deeper understanding of how to engage with philosophical material.</p>
<p><strong>Film, Ethics &amp; Theology (20 credits)<br></strong>This module will explore the way in which film may be used as a source of theological and ethical reflection and, introduce students to a range of approaches to understanding the significance of film-watching more generally. Students will be given a conceptual base on which they will then develop their own engagement with film.</p>
<p><strong>Matters of Life &amp; Death (20 credits)<br></strong>The module will take you through some of the key life and death issues in practical philosophy. You will challenge existing assumptions by identifying, critiquing and assessing arguments. By the end of the module, you will have gained a critical understanding of religious and medical ethics.</p>
<p><strong>Work Related Learning (20 credits)<br></strong>This module ensures students are aware of the requirements, resources and opportunities involved in seeking graduate career pathways, postgraduate study or, for mature students, other appropriate vocations. An important element of this module is that students research and reflect on their own learning in relation to skills and career opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Religion &amp; Human Diversity (20 credits)<br></strong>This module incorporates the study and development of research methodologies and approaches used within religious studies with a focus on the anthropology of religion. There are opportunities to study indigenous religions and cultural forms of major world religions or different Christian denominations in specific contexts; it also helps to prepare students for third year research modules allowing them to choose a religious community to study from which to begin a research project.</p>

<p><strong>Religion &amp; the Visual Arts (20 credits)<br></strong>This module explores the relationship between religion and the visual arts with a focus on contemporary art. We will cover a whole range of artistic genres, both with specific religious subject matter and without, to explore the myriad ways that religious ideas are expressed in art.</p>

								<h3>Year in industry</h3>
<p>All of our business students have the option of adding in a year in industry and / or a semester of studying abroad with one of our partners to their course. A year in industry gives students fantastic experience and is attractive to potential employers. This normally takes place after the second year of the course and extends the course duration by one year (15% of the standard tuition fee is chargeable). Study Abroad normally takes place for a semester of the second year of the course and doesn’t extend the course duration as credits achieved abroad count towards your degree.</p>
<p>You don’t need to decide whether you would like to take either of these options until after you have started the course with us.</p>

The sector accounts for 10.4% of global GDP, and one in every ten jobs is supported by the sector. There's never been a better time to start your management career in Tourism.</p>
<p class=""lede"">Our BA (Hons) Tourism and Destination Management degree will equip you with the practical skills, experience, knowledge and critical awareness that will prepare you for senior management roles in this dynamic and fast-growing sector.</p>

							<p>York is a perfect location to study tourism; the city is one of the most popular heritage and cultural destinations in the UK and welcomes around 7 million tourists a year from around the world. This provides our students with a wide range of tourism and hospitality businesses and opportunities to learn from in the local area. As well as being able to learn from local businesses, our students have the chance to work with local and regional tourism providers, attractions, destination management and marketing organisations.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of the Tourism programme at York Business School is an international field trip in the second year. Most recently, staff and students flew to New York City for a week to explore the destination. We also offer the opportunity to study abroad at one of our partnership universities. Students can take a semester or full year abroad at one of our partner institutions in Australia, the USA or across Europe.</p>
<p>Our Tourism programmes are recognised by the Tourism Management Institute (TMI). The TMI is the professional body for destination management practitioners, with members drawn from all levels of the private and public sectors. Assessment and recognition by TMI mean that students can be confident the course will provide them with knowledge, understanding, skills and experience to fully prepare them for a career in tourism destination management.</p>

								<h3>Year in industry</h3>
<p>All of our business students have the option of adding in a year in industry and / or a semester of studying abroad with one of our partners to their course. A year in industry gives students fantastic experience and is attractive to potential employers. This normally takes place after the second year of the course and extends the course duration by one year (15% of the standard tuition fee is chargeable). Study Abroad normally takes place for a semester of the second year of the course and doesn’t extend the course duration as credits achieved abroad count towards your degree.</p>
<p>You don’t need to decide whether you would like to take either of these options until after you have started the course with us.</p>

							<p>We believe that all children deserve a high-quality physical education and that all sportspeople can benefit from well-trained, responsible coaches. Our philosophy focuses less on pushing elite athletes to be the best and more on promoting healthy, enjoyable participation in sport for everyone. Alongside modules about the science of human movement, you will also study sport from social, ethical and historical perspectives. We are interested in the impact sport has on people’s lives as well as on their bodies.</p>
<p>The course balances academic theory with more practical learning. As your theoretical knowledge grows your coaching practice will develop along with it. There are plenty of opportunities to gain real-world industry experience through our extensive connections with local schools and sports teams. Our partners in the area include York City Football Club and York City Knights rugby league team. Sports teams across the city make use of our impressive Nestlé Rowntree Park Sports Campus and so will you. The site is one of the biggest of its kind in the country and is a hub for sport at the University. YSJ Active, the University’s sport and wellbeing service, also offers opportunities for our students to get involved in placements and community volunteering projects.</p>

							<p>The academic staff who teach on this course are both experienced industry professionals and outstanding researchers. Our research reflects our focus on social justice and putting the performer before the performance. Some of our recent, highly-regarded research covers bullying in sport, perfectionism in young athletes and the struggle for equality in sport. By joining us you will be part of our vibrant research environment and help push the boundaries of what we know and understand about sport.</p>

							<h4>Modules</h4>
<p><strong>Compulsory modules</strong></p>
<p><strong>Practising Responsible Business Behaviours</strong></p>
<p>This module examines the nature of business enterprise and its relationship with wider society, seeking answers to the question: what does it mean for businesses to behave responsibly? There is an ongoing debate regarding this question, with answers ranging from ‘just maximize shareholder value’ to ‘consider everyone who is affected, including unborn future generations’, with many variations in between. In this ongoing debate, we encounter ideas regarding, for example, stakeholder theory, the triple bottom line, corporate social responsibility, business ethics, the role of the state or of supra-national organizations, and so on. This module aligns well with the mission of the PRME (Principles for Responsible Management Education) (PRME) initiative to inspire and champion responsible management education. The challenge in this module of applying ideas from a complex ongoing debate to contemporary business and societal issues will support students in the development of both academic and employability skills.</p>

Learning how to market services in a service economy should thus be evidently relevant. Marketing services is different from marketing products, as services are intangible, difficult to store, vary in quality and pose additional challenges for marketers. This module will show how services can be marketed. It will build upon the principles of marketing to explain the components of the marketing mix that are unique to services (people, process and physical evidence) as well as expand students’ knowledge of how the elements of the traditional marketing mix can be applied to services. The module will give students the basics of service marketing and management theory and encourage students to apply these to real-life situations that befall service companies.</p>

							<p>International Relations and History are closely related subjects. Studying them together will deepen your understanding of the institutions, processes and events that shape states and societies. Learning about the historical events which paved the way for contemporary international politics is crucial to fully understand them. Equally, we can apply some of the modern concepts and theories behind international relations to analyse historical events and processes. This Joint Honours degree will allow you to explore this relationship, while also delving deep into specialist topics.  We have designed the modules you will study to compliment and reinforce your learning across both subjects.</p>
<p>York has played a central part in many of our country’s stories. This makes it an inspiring place to study history. There are many ways you can explore these subjects beyond the classroom. You have the opportunity to:</p>
<ul>
<li data-gc-list-depth=""1"" data-gc-list-style=""bullet"">Go on local, national and international field trips</li>
<li data-gc-list-depth=""1"" data-gc-list-style=""bullet"">Take part in a work experience project. Our connections in the city include York Museums Trust, York Explore and Yorkshire Film Archive.</li>

								<h3>Year in industry</h3>
<p>All of our business students have the option of adding in a year in industry and / or a semester of studying abroad with one of our partners to their course. A year in industry gives students fantastic experience and is attractive to potential employers. This normally takes place after the second year of the course and extends the course duration by one year (15% of the standard tuition fee is chargeable). Study Abroad normally takes place for a semester of the second year of the course and doesn’t extend the course duration as credits achieved abroad count towards your degree.</p>
<p>You don’t need to decide whether you would like to take either of these options until after you have started the course with us.</p>
