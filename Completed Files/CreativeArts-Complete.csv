                    <p>Year 0 introduces you to the making and thinking skills around being an artist. There are four units to this programme – some running concurrently - that help you to explore and test out a wide range of ideas, materials and processes, as well as how to develop practice from research. There is also a program of international visiting artists and supported writing tasks to support you with your studio work. Within a tutor led and energetic fine art community, you will be encouraged to explore a critical approach to your thinking. This is done through lectures and seminars, one to one teaching and group work.</p>
<p><strong>Studio Testing 1</strong><br>This unit begins the process of establishing an individual art practice, introducing students to a variety of approaches to the practices and processes of art making. The unit will be delivered through weekly tasks, seminars and studio discussions where students will be encouraged to experiment with a range of mediums and processes.</p>
<p><strong>Studio Testing 2</strong><br>Students will be encouraged to explore how art can be understood through discussion of concepts and testing in relation to their individual and developing studio practice. This allows for a more sustained and longer period of time to develop ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Contexts</strong><br>This unit will enable you to develop skills and approaches to support your understanding of contemporary art, and to recognise possible contexts for their developing practice. There will be a series of tutor-led seminars in which students investigate and discuss the work and ideas of a number of modern and contemporary artists.  This is in supportive environment with other group members.  </p>
<p><strong>Materials and Processes</strong><br>This unit aims to introduce basic making methodologies across a range of mediums and processes, which will enable students to develop their understanding of how to approach material problem solving in their studio practice. This unit is supported by a series of workshops to develop your technical skills in a wide range of disciplines for example, printmaking, 3D material exploration and photography and film making.</p>

                    <p>The first year of the course encourages your curiosity, and through four units – some running concurrently - you’ll explore how you think about fine art and how you make it, produce work and learn production, dissemination and reception of contemporary art. You will be encouraged to develop an increasing independence in how you take your work and ideas forward.</p>
<p><strong>Studio Practice 1<br></strong>Through innovative approaches to making and thinking about fine art, you’ll be challenged about how you think about it as a subject, broadening and deepening your understanding so you can free yourself of habitual assumptions and practices and generating an experimental body of work in the process. This project encourages you to make a body of work from ideas that have sparked your interest, complimented by a series of practical workshops.</p>
<p><strong>Studio Practice 2</strong><br> This unit builds on what you have learnt in Studio Practice 1, and allows more of a focus on your choice of context(s) within your studio work – its narratives, subject matters, materials, processes.  This project allows you to develop an increasing independence to explore ideas and themes.</p>
<p><strong>History and Theory<br></strong>This unit introduces historical and theoretical research as a way to better understand art practice. You’ll be shown a range of approaches, discourses and models found in recent and contemporary art practice, and you’ll explore these within wider intellectual, cultural and global contexts.  You will have a series of lectures and seminars that support you to learn about and discuss contemporary art and write about it.</p>
<p><strong>Context and Display<br></strong>This unit will look at the different ways contemporary art is made, analysed, consumed and received, in intellectual and wider cultural spheres. This process allows you to test your understanding and develop your practice by displaying and installing your work in public places.</p>

<br><br>Our Games Design course, run at UCA Rochester, covers the full indie game development pipeline, from planning and concept to publishing. Blending games art, games design and critical thinking with professional skills and project management for the indie sector, this course will prepare graduates to join a team in an independent studio or undertake their own development projects.
<br><br>You’ll be able to focus on your own individual approach to games design as you develop a personal game style and portfolio. You’ll also work within small, agile teams, where each contributor usually performs more than one role, has more creative ownership over the result, and is able to innovate and challenge what has gone before.
<br><br>With access to excellent facilities and high-end technology, plus the support of experienced staff with strong links to the indie gaming industry, you’ll graduate with the skills and tools you need to jump right into your dream career.</p>

                    <p><strong>Art and Design</strong><br> Learn key drawing skills, visual design skills, conceptual approaches and software so you can develop ideas into art assets for indie games development. You will learn how to approach visual problems creatively using a range of sources for inspiration and reference. You will be introduced to software, through which you will produce a digital and non-digital outcome, demonstrating your conceptual approach, drawing skills and technical understanding.</p>
<p><strong>Animation</strong><br>Building upon Art and Design, you’ll be introduced to key skills, conceptual approaches and software to develop ideas into animated assets for indie computer games. You will gain a solid grounding into the principles and processes of real time animation for computer games, from traditional drawing skills to animation in software, producing digital and non-digital outcomes demonstrating your technical and conceptual skills.</p>
<p><strong>Interaction</strong><br>This unit introduces you to the fundamental concepts of gameplay, design, prototyping (analogue and digital) and visual scripting. You will produce digital and non-digital outcomes demonstrating your technical and conceptual skills and will end up with dozens of experiments, ideas and prototypes to draw on in future practice.</p>
<p><strong>Moving Image Culture: Understanding and Interpretation</strong><br>With a focus on video games and the history of their theorisation, this unit introduces you to a range of key concepts central to the understanding of historical and contemporary moving image culture. You will also become familiar with the technological developments and conceptual transformations, before and after the so-called digital shift, establishing a firm understanding of the technical and intellectual changes that have influenced the development of the video game as a medium.</p>

It should explore how values are communicated in games, and how we can make games to explore deep, meaningful topics and personal narratives.  You'll undertake this unit individually, and produce both digital and non-digital outcomes that reflect your design skill and ability to express yourself artistically.</p>
<p><strong>Games Production</strong><br>This unit introduces you to contemporary games production practices ,the roles of those involved, and gives you the opportunity to produce work as part of a group over the course of the whole year. You’ll work in a team to design two games, in an iterative fashion as you would in a contemporary games development studio. Together you’ll contribute to the design and programme elements of production, deliver pitch presentations and prototypes of your projects, and adhere to milestones where consistent progress and good time-management forms a major part of the final assessment.</p>
<p><strong>Gaming Culture</strong><br> Critically examining the position of computer games and gamers within culture and society, this unit explores concepts and issues central to the historical, theoretical and aesthetic dimensions of the gaming practice. You’ll explore gaming’s relationship to gender, ethnicity, conflict and capital, before turning a critical eye inwards to discuss ludology and its attendant concepts, including immersion, procedural rhetoric and cyber-individualism.</p>
<p>You'll also take part in follow-up practical prototyping exercises based on the themes of your lectures, to demonstrate creativity, generative capacity of critical and contextual knowledge, and to encourage quick, experimental development practices.</p>

                    <p><strong>Introduction to Visual Communication</strong><br>You'll explore how Graphic Design shapes form and content across the spectrum of media, from the printed page to the internet, and will work to articulate your own personal voice as a designer and artist, while fashioning messages that communicate to various communities and are relevant to contemporary culture.</p>
<p><strong>Design Fundamentals 1: Image, Type, Print</strong><br>You'll be introduced to how different meanings can be constructed through a variety of type and image constellations. You will also learn how these are applied to and affected by different print mediums and formats.</p>
<p><strong>Design Fundamentals 2: Motion, Narrative, Screen</strong><br>This unit introduces narrative, sequence and interactivity as thematic concepts that can be applied to a screen-based design outcome. You will be asked to consider how visual language, such as words, images, materials, format and structure, can support narrative.</p>
<p><strong>Visual Theory: Message, Medium, Meaning</strong><br>Through the exploration of examples from historical and contemporary practice and analysis of your studio work, you'll examine a range of topics. These will include basic concepts in semiotics, the relationship between word and image, the construction of narrative, photographic language, function and expression, culture connotation and myth, subversion and propaganda.</p>

                    <p>The first year of the course encourages your curiosity, and through four units – some running concurrently - you’ll explore how you think about fine art and how you make it, produce work and learn production, dissemination and reception of contemporary art. You will be encouraged to develop an increasing independence in how you take your work and ideas forward.</p>
<p><strong>Studio Practice 1</strong> <br>Through innovative approaches to making and thinking about fine art, you’ll be challenged about how you think about it as a subject, broadening and deepening your understanding so you can free yourself of habitual assumptions and practices and generating an experimental body of work in the process. This project encourages you to make a body of work from ideas that have sparked your interest, complimented by a series of practical workshops.</p>
<p><strong>Studio Practice 2</strong><br>This unit builds on what you have learnt in Studio Practice 1, and allows more of a focus on your choice of context(s) within your studio work – its narratives, subject matters, materials, processes.  This project allows you to develop an increasing independence to explore ideas and themes.</p>
<p><strong>History and Theory<br></strong>This unit introduces historical and theoretical research as a way to better understand art practice. You’ll be shown a range of approaches, discourses and models found in recent and contemporary art practice, and you’ll explore these within wider intellectual, cultural and global contexts. You will have a series of lectures and seminars that support you to learn about and discuss contemporary art and write about it.</p>
<p><strong>Context and Display</strong><br>This unit will look at the different ways contemporary art is made, analysed, consumed and received, in intellectual and wider cultural spheres. This process allows you to test your understanding and develop your practice by displaying and installing your work in public places.</p>

                    <p>This year encourages you to speculate with ideas and questions about your work, and we’ll be asking you to think about your own practice in terms of context and supporting you to work more independently. You will get an opportunity to exhibit your work in a public-facing arena. You will also be encouraged to participate collaboratively with other students and also to consider opportunities with the wider network organisations such as Canterbury Cathedral or the Stour Valley Creative Partnership. </p>
<p><strong>Contemporary Art Practice 1</strong><br>You’ll develop your individual practice within a more specialised and collaborative studio and research environment, and you’ll explore how your art should be displayed with test installations on campus. Teaching on the unit is delivered through a number of tutor-led groups each group representing a range of skills and practices. You will also participate in a seminar programme where a range of contextual positions are presented and discussed. </p>
<p><strong>Contemporary Art Practice 2</strong><br>Contemporary Art Practice 2 is a continuation of Contemporary Art Practice 1, emphasising the focussing and refining of your studio work as a specialised practice, underpinned by creative and innovative approaches in the context of contemporary art. In this unit you will be offered to consider a variety of curatorial and intellectual propositions in terms of situating art practice within wider social, cultural, intellectual or institutional terms, as a professional practice, and in relation to audience.  The unit will be organised through continued development of studio practice and development of individual or collective projects to be realised off-site.</p>

					<p>If you are considering becoming a sought-after Technical Artist within the gaming industry, then our Games Technology course, taught in state-of-the-art facilities at UCA Farnham, is the ideal games degree for you.
<br><br>This industry-focused degree course is founded on the principles of User-Centred Design (UCD) and Human Computer Interaction (HCI), and you’ll learn how to consider the user throughout each stage of the game design and development process.
<br><br>As you explore game design, you’ll have access to the very latest hardware and software – Alienware Aurora towers, 4k dual screens, RTX 2080 graphics cards and SSD HDs, with Unity and Unreal games engines for prototyping. As the course progresses, you’ll be able to test your games on the very latest Dev Kits, including those from Sony PlayStation, as part of the Sony PlayStation First Academic Development programme.
<br><br>This course sits alongside the established and highly regarded BA (Hons) Games Arts degree, and you’ll have plenty of opportunities to collaborate with students on that programme as you make game prototypes together. You’ll also get to take part in Game Jams with your peers across our games degrees, mirroring industry approaches to idea iteration and team development.
<br><br>When it comes to industry links, you’ll benefit from our connections with games brands including Rebellion, SEGA, Creative Assembly and Super Massive Games, and graduate with all the tools you need for a successful career.
<br><br>Past graduates have gone on to work for AAA, iii and indie games companies across the UK and abroad.</p>

                <div class=""content"">
                    <p>This year will take you through fundamental games design processes and the technical foundations of 2D and 3D programming, understanding games engines, as well as planning and creating games. You’ll share theoretical units with students on the Games Arts course.</p>
<p><strong>Games Design</strong><br>You’ll be introduced to the key digital art and design skills needed to complement your technical skills, with which you’ll transform your research and develop ideas into functional assets for games. You'll learn how to approach problems creatively using a range of sources for reference and inspiration.</p>
<p><strong>Games Programming</strong><br>Specific to this course, you’ll learn the fundamentals of working in Unreal Engine, using Blueprints, the basics of C++ programming and gain a solid grounding in gaming systems and platforms, the system architecture of these platforms and the similarities between them.</p>
<p>You'll be introduced to fundamental mathematics for computing before moving on to Procedural and Object-Orientated Programming. You'll also demonstrate your technical understanding through this unit by producing simple games.</p>
<p><strong>Interaction</strong><br>Through the fundamental concepts of gameplay, computer games design, and computer games scripting and C# coding using the Unity games engine, you’ll learn about how games interact with users.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction to Video Game Studies: Image, Medium and Culture <br></strong>This unit introduces you to a range of key concepts central to developing an understanding of video games and the history of their theorisation. Exploring influential video game examples and relevant theoretical and critical writings, you will analyse the cultural and artistic contexts in which the medium has been theorised, produced and played. You will also become familiar with the technological developments and conceptual transformations, before and after the so called digital shift, establishing a firm understanding of the technical and intellectual changes that have influenced the development of the video game as a medium.</p>

                    <p>Year two will build upon your planning, design, asset creation and prototyping skills. You’ll start to specialise in a defined area, and continue to undertake shared units with students on the Games Arts course.</p>
<p>As the course progresses, you’ll develop your practical skills further in the programming language C++, alongside contextual studies. </p>
<p><strong>Games System Design</strong><br>Through this unit you will further build on your knowledge of digital systems and programming skills. Specifically, you will be introduced to C++, gaining understanding of its key concepts and features and demonstrating your understanding in response to briefs. Complementing the explicitly technical focus of this unit you’ll be encouraged to be creative – your work may be entrepreneurial or speculative, you might look beyond gaming for entertainment to areas like ‘Serious/ Applied Games’, ‘Games as Social Political Comment’ or ‘Games as Art’. </p>
<p><strong>Games Production</strong><br>Contemporary games production practices and workflows are crucial to the success of a game. You’ll learn how to work in small dev teams, iterate and develop to milestones, while creating high-quality work. You’ll learn the process of making a game environment and the roles of those involved, specifically exploring mechanics, environment production techniques and workflows. From there, you’ll work in groups to create a prototype – in an iterative fashion as you would in contemporary game production practice.</p>
<p>You’ll also work in a group to successfully pitch a game concept, and develop a prototype or ‘vertical slice’. Each member of your group will need to specialise in a specific area appropriate to their skills and interests, however all members should be involved in the production.</p>
<p><strong>Gaming in Contemporary Culture</strong><br>You’ll critically examine the position of computer games and gamers within culture and society, exploring gaming's relationship to gender, ethnicity, conflict and capital. You’ll also discuss ludology and its attendant concepts, including immersion, procedural rhetoric and cyber-individualism.</p>

<p><strong>Moving Image Culture: Understanding &amp; Interpretation</strong><br> We’ll introduce you to the key concepts of historical and contemporary moving image culture. You’ll become familiar with technical innovations and conceptual transformations, and will consider the ideological institutions and cultural practices that shape the production and experience of cinema, computer games and networked media – including the politics of representation.</p>
<p><strong>Imagining Reality</strong><br> You’ll explore documentary practices as well as the representation of reality through formal approaches such as the poetic, observational, reflexive, expository and performative. You’ll cover a range of diverse methodologies which challenge the notion of the real, from historical and contemporary perspectives, while developing skills in film language, cinematography, sound recording, post-production techniques and research methods.</p>
<p><strong>Experimental Media</strong><br> You’ll be introduced to experimental film, video and sound art, and will examine the inter-relationship between experimental moving image, cinema and fine art practice. You’ll produce a portfolio of experimental video and sound work, enabling you to explore theoretical concepts through practice. You’ll experiment with avant-garde forms and create work that challenges conventions.</p>
<p><strong>Portraits</strong><br> You’ll further develop your visual language and familiarity with lens-based practices by considering the core skills of photography and image manipulation. You’ll explore aspects of identity and develop an awareness of the constructed nature of the ‘self’ in relation to gender, sexuality, socio-economic status, ethnicity and community groupings.

<p><strong>Cultures of Convergence</strong><br> You’ll investigate the relationship between contemporary art practice and theory, and the proliferation of new technologies over the past three decades. You’ll expand your understanding of digital convergence, and consider the formation of new social and cultural identities under the influence of new technologies and hybridisation. You’ll cover issues such as the critical approaches to new media technologies, interactive multimedia, hybrid artistic practices, post-internet art, and the construction of identity and difference in the digital age.</p>
<p><strong>Innovation &amp; Interference</strong><br> We’ll encourage you to be inventive and imaginative in your interpretation of conceptual themes, and to develop your critical thinking within the context of moving image and hybrid digital practices. You’ll create two productions – which could take the form of expanded cinema, an experimental art piece, an installation, an expanded documentary or narrative, or a video dance composition. You’ll reflect upon and refine your work, considering audience and dissemination as key factors.</p>
<p><strong>Professional Toolkit</strong><br> This technical skills development unit will support the ongoing development of projects during the year. You’ll build on your existing skills to develop specialist knowledge of areas of moving image and digital image production. The specialist areas you choose to focus on may include digital video editing, visual effects, sound design, 3D or 2D modelling and animation, coding for interactivity, digital photography and studio production workflow.</p>

					<p>Our ground-breaking MA Virtual Fashion course, taught by an award-winning team of researchers, industry practitioners and academics will take creative fashion thinkers and designers into a new and exciting digital world.
<br><br>This one year, full-time course is the only one of its kind and has been designed specifically to meet the requirements of a growing number of major brands – from Gucci and Louis Vuitton to major high street players – who are moving into the virtual market, where fashion is instant, eye-catching, sustainable and entirely digital.
<br><br>You will be taught how to create garments which are completely free from the material world, and how to fit them digitally to a client – whether that’s a model for a virtual catwalk, a social media influencer looking to boost their reach, a gaming avatar looking for a fashion edge or a bespoke costume for a movie character.
<br><br>Currently, designer virtual garments are selling for thousands of pounds – a virtual Gucci gown which will never exist in the physical world recently sold for $9,000 – showing just how lucrative the market is. 
<br><br>And eventually, it’s expected this new way of wearing the latest looks will extend to the High Street, where regular shoppers will have the chance to “try before they buy” in a virtual changing room from the comfort of their own home.
<br><br>These innovations allow fashion brands and businesses to market their ranges in a more sustainable way, reducing cost and waste by eliminating the need for samples and broadening their market to wider and more marginal communities.
<br><br>Owing to the wide range of clients keen to take advantage of virtual fashion, this course is not only open to fashion graduates but also to those from a background in games, film, animation and graphic design – though if you come from one of these fields, you should expect some intensive learning to bring you up to speed on creating fashion garments.
<br><br>With our extensive industry links and the very latest in technological facilities – including our new 3D Gerber Accumark - we’ll provide you with the foundations to step into a growing and competitive job market with confidence, giving you the skills and the creative thinking to dress the virtual world.

<p>Using a project proposal from your undergraduate studies or a new proposal you have created, you’ll be asked to identify the virtual fashion concept you wish to develop. From concept to the virtual catwalk, you will develop 3D narratives for fashion, exploring how we will interact with digital identities and buy fashion in the future.</p>
<p>As part of your studies you will engage in critical enquiry, investigate contemporary and future innovations in design and experiential fashion concepts, and research market positioning and consumer behaviour.</p>

<br><br>Best suited to those with a hands-on, making background, you’ll be encouraged to think beyond a product itself, challenged to consider how the way a product is designed can influence an emotion or impact a space, and break away from convention as you tie in the traditional with the cutting edge.
<br><br>UCA Farnham has a rich history and industry-wide reputation for its design courses and on this course, you’ll learn from a team of talented academics as well as visiting lecturers and partners with a wealth of industry experience.
<br><br>You’ll undertake individual research projects using an integrated product design process, and develop design solutions which fit with an overarching theme, and for added inspiration you’ll have the opportunity to go on a study visit abroad alongside undergraduate design students and alumni, maintaining the sense of community among students.
<br><br>UCA is extremely proud to encourage and develop sustainable design, and the Farnham campus is home to The Centre for Sustainable Design - a research centre which facilitates discussion and research on eco-design, and broader sustainability considerations in product and service development.
<br><br>Graduates from our MA Product Design course have gone on to work in architectural firms, independent design studios, create their own businesses and roles in design management. Demand is high for graduates with technical skills in the product design industry, particularly those who have access to industry quality equipment and the know-how and passion to succeed.

                    <p><strong>Critical Perspectives</strong><br>Through a series of lectures, discussions in seminar sessions and written pieces, you’ll examine the meaning of contemporary practice and methods of working, alongside students from the MA Fine Art course.</p>
<p>Together, you’ll learn about the range of theoretical and critical debates which have impacted significantly on recent contemporary practice. As well as understanding how these relate to political and social contexts, you’ll also consider the materials you use, and how they might be placed in wider culture.</p>
<p><strong>Exploratory Practice</strong><br>You’ll be testing out and trying ideas, methods and materials to expand your breadth of knowledge and fields of interest. We will be expecting you to show your curiosity, experiment, take risks and be daring.</p>
<p>You'll develop a true sense of what materials and tools you want to use, and why, and the enquiries you want to follow, and why. You will discover the joy of your craft, not only in the practice of photography and theory, but also in the conception and research of your ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Research and Development</strong><br>In order to truly understand how research is completely embedded in your practice, you’ll develop the skills to exhaustively research particular methods, approaches, theories and practices, to further your experimental work.</p>
<p>You'll also thoroughly explore the photography industry and its subsidiaries on a global scale, in order to better prepare you for professional practice or other careers. </p>
<p><strong>International Exchange (optional)</strong><br> Thanks to the course's connections with a range of world-leading international institutions – including in India, Sweden, Spain and the USA - you will have the opportunity to undertake a period of study abroad. This is ideally taken in term two of year one or term three of year two.</p>

					<p>Contemporary illustration practice has grown to encompass a broad range of ambitions and opportunities for image makers and storytellers. The growth of online digital cultures - and the impact of digital image creation on traditional image making - requires flexible and adaptable practitioners, and it provides unique opportunities for the entrepreneurial illustrator. 
<br><br>Our course offers you the chance to challenge the boundaries of illustration, both in its practice and its context, and is primarily concerned with the illustrated narrative. It offers you a creative and intellectual environment in which you can rigorously pursue a project of self-directed study, and produce a body of work on a topic of your interest within the field of illustration.
<br><br>Our course enjoys a long tradition of original narrative and storytelling through images, reflecting staff expertise and practice in these areas. As a student here you'll get to explore narrative storytelling, authorship, self-publishing, book production and visual narratives through the development of a personal project.
<br><br>This MA course supports you to develop your own independent voice and to identify an audience. You're encouraged to take a self-directed entrepreneurial approach, developing and exploring creative opportunities and options for your work. This entrepreneurial emphasis will be supported by access to specialist facilities such as digital media suites, photography, printmaking and bookmaking.
<br><br>Our course also provides you with the opportunity for extended critical debate, a high degree of critical reflection and integration of theoretical and practical concerns as part of an ambitious body of work. It will also promote in-depth, rigorously conducted research, to ensure you're able to contextualise your own work in relation to the leading practices in illustration.
<br><br>Visiting lecturers and practitioners inform and cultivate professional development, encouraging you to question and debate. Recent visiting lecturers have included Graham Rawle, Olivier Kugler, Nick White, Luke Best, Mathew Richardson and Posy Simmonds.

					<p>As a student of our MA Fine Art course at Farnham, you’ll be ready to question, be critical, be curious and be enthusiastic about testing the boundaries of what constitutes art practice in the 21st Century.
<br><br>Throughout this MA, you’ll critically evaluate your own work and the work of others and constantly develop your visual and conceptual thinking - all with the aim of establishing and refining a research project to be developed into either a practice-based or theoretically-led enquiry beyond graduation.
<br><br>You’ll test the relationship between your work and key historical and critical developments, and consider it within current societal and political contexts. You’ll also have the opportunity, if you wish, to specialise within or across subject areas.
<br><br>Our course also welcomes applicants who are looking to re-examine their current work and research.
<br><br>MA Fine Art in Farnham is unique for its world-leading research and range of first-class facilities, including bronze foundry, printmaking studios, metals, wood and casting facilities and resources. We provide specialist studio spaces for both full and part-time students, and dedicated technical staff are on hand to support individual projects as well as introductions to workshop areas.
<br><br>You’ll be guided by a community of teaching staff comprising professional artists, curators and theorists, who will also actively promote you and your work in the wider world.
<br><br>The department has a rich tradition in the teaching and exploration of fine art. All of the staff are research practitioners and many are world-leading, contributing to the wider development of knowledge within their specialist areas.

                    <p><strong>Critical Perspectives</strong><br>Through a series of lectures, discussions in seminar sessions and written pieces, you’ll examine the meaning of contemporary practice and methods of working, alongside students from the MFA Photography course.</p>
<p>Together, you’ll learn about the range of theoretical and critical debates which have impacted significantly on recent contemporary practice. As well as understanding how these relate to political and social contexts, you’ll also consider the materials you use, and how they might be placed in wider culture.</p>
<p><strong>Research and Practice</strong><br>You’ll devise an initial study proposal, in consultation with your tutors. While experimentation and open enquiry is encouraged, you’ll need to present a coherent framework for this investigation, which will be critiqued, discussed and updated as the unit progresses. This will ensure your enquiry remains within and around the focus subjects of current critical debates. You’ll also learn about how best to present your practice externally, as part of your development and growth as an artist.</p>

					<p>In a reflective and challenging environment, our postgraduate Fine Art course has a cross-disciplinary structure which encourages you to engage with what it means to practise as an artist today.
<br><br>You’ll work closely with local and national galleries and public arts organisations, including Turner Contemporary, Whitstable Biennale, Strange Cargo and the Folkestone Triennial – and you’ll be actively supported to develop and show work outside the context of the University, expanding your work’s audiences.
<br><br>Guest lectures, artist masterclasses and professional practice seminars will help you develop your personal network and enhance the criticality and articulation of your practice.
<br><br>Our course is open to artists, designers, illustrators, architects and theorists – including graduates in the humanities – and is designed to inspire new and innovative approaches to fine art study at an advanced level.
<br><br>It’s supported by seminars, tutorials, workshops, work-in-progress sessions, study visits and critiques. By the end of the course you’ll be working autonomously, instead of staff-led, as you identify, develop and manage your own Masters project across different social, cultural, artistic and intellectual contexts.
<br><br>Our course is helmed by a team of esteemed tutors, who each continue to enjoy great success in their respective fields. Guiding you on your studies will be Steffi Klenz, an internationally-recognised photographic artist, Edward Chell, a mixed media artist who specialises in painting and Professor Andrew Kotting, who is an award-winning short film and documentary maker.
<br><br>We take great pride in ensuring you have a fulfilling, engaging and inspirational experience and we’re especially proud of the fact our student satisfaction rates consistently reflect this with a near 100 per cent score.</p>

In seminars and lectures you’ll discuss texts drawn from artistic, literary and philosophical contexts. This will help you consider your own ideas, and you’ll also learn about what research methods are available to you for your studies.</p>
<p><strong>Exploring Practice<br></strong>Running in parallel with Contest and Method, you’ll explore your own creative practice - and how it fits into the wider context of contemporary art - through practical enquiry, group discussion of ongoing work and one-to-one tutorials. This will help you refine what areas of art interest you most, and help you put together your MA project proposal, a written document, which is assessed at the end of the unit alongside a presentation of your practical work.</p>

					<p>An exciting opportunity to develop your professional skills and managerial capabilities, our Design &amp; Brand Management course gives you the opportunity to study a combined curriculum that will significantly enhance your skillset to become leading brand, design and innovation managers. 
<br><br>Our course encourages you to consider the value of branding in today's competitive global environment, where organisations continue to compete in overcrowded markets. As consumers become more sophisticated and the plethora of products more similar, the need to differentiate through emotional attachment has become increasingly important, and this is where UCA’s bespoke Design &amp; Brand Management course steps in to help future leaders develop one-of-a-kind products and fresh campaign strategies.
<br><br>The key to successful brand development is an understanding of its synergistic relationship with innovation. The popular view has been that branding is connected with logos, advertising and manipulation, whilst innovation is to do with more process-orientated development. UCA has developed this postgraduate course to address all aspects of product design, brand management and the innovation factors that lie as a foundation for its success.
<br><br>We will cover each key component and teach you how to run these successfully, while also developing your own professional and personal development as leaders along the way. For us, branding is about delivering a rewarding experience to customers, while innovation is about an organisational effort aimed at differentiating a company through original value creation. In other words, each is inextricably linked yet individually defined.
<br><br>As a student on this course, you'll benefit from working alongside students on the other postgraduate courses at UCA Epsom to better understand the range of products available in today’s market, their similarities, strengths and weaknesses, and above all develop and deliver customer centric produce.
<br><br>Please note: this course title is new for 2021 entry. The course is named MA Design, Innovation &amp; Brand Management for 2020 entry.</p>

<p><strong>Design Research 01<br></strong>You’ll embark on an extended piece of complex architectural design research, leading to a rigorous proposal. It should demonstrate your ability to devise ambitious architectural strategies, structural and sustainable objectives and approaches and coherent responses to site within the project as a whole.</p>
<p><strong>Design Research 02<br></strong>You will extend and amplify the architectural design research initiated in the first module, leading to a rigorous proposal or proposals for a complex architectural design.</p>
<p><strong>Design Technology<br></strong>You will devise and implement a programme of research into technologies and experimentation. This usually emerges from the themes and issues in your design research project. The unit includes a series of programmed interdisciplinary workshops to introduce key skills and concepts, providing specialist inputs and opportunities to evaluate individual research from different vantage points.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>Dissertation (option1)<br></strong>This unit comprises a period of self-directed research on a subject related to the historical, theoretical and critical concerns of architecture. You will present a written dissertation (8,000-10,000 words) in which you will be expected to develop and articulate a sustained argument that demonstrates a high level of understanding of the subject area through analysis and evaluation.</p>
<p><strong>Dissertation (option 2)<br></strong>As with option 1, your dissertation will relate to the historical, theoretical and critical concerns of architecture. You will complete a research project, presented using alternate media (film, installation, software etc.) and an exegesis (2,000-3,500 words).</p>

<p><strong>Thesis 02<br></strong>This second phase involves the development and presentation of the thesis. The format of presentation is agreed with individual thesis tutors and may include the production of models, drawings, installation, video, photography and text.</p>
<p><strong>Future Practice<br></strong>Through lectures, workshops and tutorials, this unit is designed to provoke experimentation, risk-taking, exploratory and playful work while addressing the rigours of professional practice. A range of topics, including business (including marketing and advertising), economics, law and legal, management, media, systems and operation, and professional practices will be covered. There is also a series of talks centred around the RIBA stages: pre-agreement, ideas-design, pre-construction, construction and completion.</p>
<p><strong>Realisation<br></strong>You'll produce a technologically-driven realisation which arises out of an issue identified in your design Thesis.

					<p>Our MA Architecture course enables you to develop an individual approach to spatial design within a stimulating, creative and supportive environment.
<br><br>Our MA Architecture course is a research-focused programme that advances your knowledge of built and occupied space. For us, architecture is not only concerned with buildings and construction details, but also how people perceive and understand space at a fundamental level. Through engagement with experimental design practice both digital and analogue in workshops and studio, and therefore increasing your specialist knowledge, you improve your ability to manage and deliver practical projects whilst engaging with technology and innovative design.
<br><br>Our students speculate upon possible outcomes and alternate realities that have grown from contemporary technologies; we do so through an assimilation and expert application of making skills and artistic craft knowledge, which is readily accessible in the wider UCA community.
<br><br>You'll have the opportunity to undertake individual thematic investigations which will incorporate prototyping, experimenting, re-designing and crafting. You will be expected to demonstrate expert knowledge of your chosen field of interest and complete mastery of your fabricated outcomes. At the end of the course you'll become responsible for the design of a piece of work that will act as a unique expression of the expertise you've developed with us.
<br><br>Our School of Architecture maintains strong relationships with the professionals and organisations in the industry, and our course team are well-placed to provide you with industry links that could lead to further experience and career development and higher level study such as PhD. </p>

					<p>Do you have a passion for designing and making? For colour? For experimenting with materials? Our BA (Hons) Textile Design degree at UCA Farnham will inspire you to indulge your desire to design and make individual textiles for art, architecture, fashion, interiors, lifestyle and luxury.
<br><br>On this course you’ll working with experienced academics, technical staff and visiting lecturers, drawing on a wealth of knowledge and skill as you explore and refine your own craft. You’ll work on real-world collaborations, projects and exhibitions, with an opportunity to undertake a work placement.
<br><br>Along the way you’ll learn traditional skills through a combination of experimental craft techniques, and you’ll have access to a range of textile equipment, as well as yarn and cloth dyeing labs, chemical mixing rooms and specialist finishing areas.
<br><br>Some of our graduates have gone on to work for high profile designers and manufacturers including Burberry, Paul Smith, Jaeger, Zoffany and David Linley. Others have set up their own businesses and become designer-makers, textile artists, academics and researchers.</p>

                    <p>In the first year, you'll learn new design and technical skills which enable you to create original textiles from scratch. Practical skills include a series of workshops and inductions in drawing and mark-making, colour origination, materials, processes, techniques in print/surface and weave/constructed. Sustainable practice will be introduced and continued throughout each stage of the course. Complemented by contextual studies units introducing you to the theory side of art, crafts and design. </p>
<p><strong>Textile Practice Process 1</strong><br>You’ll also be introduced to fundamental skills and knowledge that provides the subject learning foundation to inform your design and making process. You’ll be introduced to the act of making as a key skill and means of experimental research through the exploration of materials and processes. </p>
<p><strong>Contextual Studies 1</strong><br>Through a series of illustrated lectures and seminars, the unit will explore a range of theoretical and practice-based positions in order to demonstrate the rich diversity of existing approaches to crafts and design, and to consider specific aesthetic decisions in relation to their contexts.</p>
<p><strong>Textile Practice Process 2</strong><br>The purpose of this unit is to extend existing and develop new material knowledge and process skills, covering research, idea generation, conceptualisation, iterative exploration, design development, documentation, evaluation, resolution and communication through your individual responses to project briefs.</p>
<p><strong>Textile Practice Process 3</strong><br>Consolidating competency in the range of skills previously developed, and acquiring new skills that support increasingly confident and accomplished responses to more complex project briefs, is the aim of this unit in preparation for your second year of study. You'll extend your understanding of the subject context for your work and begin to explore a relevant textile focus. </p>

To stretch your concepts and enhance your skills and professional development, you'll have the opportunity to take part in industry live competitions, a work placement and a study abroad year.</p>
<p><strong>Textile Practice Exploration 1</strong><br>The purpose of this unit is for you to start developing and exploring your individual design identity and interest. This is undertaken through engagement with conceptually-led textile project brief(s) including where possible, live projects, collaborations, competitions and placement to link with industry.</p>
<p><strong>Contextual Studies 2</strong><br>Objects and environments are fundamental to our understanding of the world. The purpose of this unit is to introduce a range of contexts demonstrating the importance of meaning, and the ways this meaning can be used to create and express value within crafts and design practices. The things we make and use have ‘lives’ - they are conceived, designed and produced through chosen materials and processes before being mediated in public and often experienced and consumed privately.</p>
<p><strong>Textile Practice Exploration 2</strong><br>You’ll extend and further develop individual design identity and interest through briefs which incorporate all stages of the design process from beginning to resolution and include live projects, collaborations, competitions and placement where possible. You are encouraged to actively explore contrasts of approach to test your individual identity and project outcome/s.</p>
<p><strong>Textile Practice Exploration 3</strong><br>You’ll be encouraged to develop and refine your individual practice approaches to research, designing and making and refining your outcome as you begin to identify potential areas of interest for further pursuit in third year study. </p>

You will be required to research, plan and produce a short news or current affairs item for multi-platform transmission. You are required to write, visualise and strategically plan your production, taking into account the demands of broadcasters, the expectations of audiences, and the technical aspects of online and multi-platform transmission.</p>
<p><strong>Fiction Adaptation (optional)</strong><br>You are required to research, plan and produce a short video for transmission, adapted or derived from a literary source. You will be encouraged to experiment with visual representation and advanced filmmaking, such as montage and time-lapse, as well as dramatisation and text and sound design.</p>
<p><strong>Professional Practice (optional)</strong><br>This unit challenges you to engage with professional practice, with the aim to focus the knowledge and critical understanding of what it is to be a professional in the moving image production industry. Set within an industrial context, you have the opportunity to engage with an employer through a work placement or a commissioned moving image project. Working closely to the employers’ requirements, you will be required to employ professional research, and production skills, as well as negotiate, collaborate, communicate, and be receptive and adaptive to feedback.</p>
<p><strong>As Live Production</strong><br>As Live Television Productions (a programme recorded in one take as if it’s live but not actually broadcast until later) is a cornerstone of commercial television output. From game shows to talk shows, current affairs to cultural spin, As Live productions demand sophisticated skills and large-scale coordination of people and resources. This unit requires the development of a detailed pitch for, and subsequent production of, an As Live Studio Production pilot. The idea(s) considered to have most potential by a commissioning panel will be given the green light to go into production. A creative team is then formed to develop the concept through to transmission.</p>
<p><strong>Transition</strong><br>You’ll begin the process of focusing your own practice within a chosen production role and context, ready for the transition into your final year of study. Independent study, research and critical analysis will inform and underpin the project. You will be encouraged to focus on a chosen role (writer, producer, director, director of photography or editor) and a particular output (drama, documentary, current affairs, entertainment or similar). Using an existing source of material (for example a television drama series or a documentary) you will be asked to re-interpret an aspect of the work from the perspective of your chosen skillset.</p>
<p><strong>Television: Critical Perspectives</strong><br>This unit brings the opportunity to explore television formats through in-depth critical analysis of television genre, with particular reference to broadcast journalism and drama. It also supports the development of a greater understanding and critical analysis of television genre and audiences, developing further skills in research, critique, presentation and academic writing.</p>
<p><strong>Study abroad (optional)</strong><br>This course offers the opportunity to study abroad for one term during your second year.</p>

					<p>On our Television &amp; Media Production course at UCA Farnham you’ll learn all the skills you’ll need to become a versatile player in the media industry, whether behind or in front of studio cameras, directing drama, documentary or comedy, reading the news for television, or editing work you’ve written and filmed.
<br><br>Working across radio, television and online studio production in our extensive facilities, you’ll develop the advanced production techniques needed to produce informed pieces for journalistic, documentary and fiction purposes.
<br><br>You’ll develop skills in writing and visual storytelling and work on a number of live briefs, giving you the chance to experience a realistic simulation of a working studio atmosphere.
<br><br>As well as discovering how to disseminate your content across multiple platforms, you’ll also learn how to identify a great story, develop your interviewing techniques and become versatile in writing for different audiences.</p>

                    <p><strong>Finding and Writing Stories<br></strong>Whether you want to be a programme maker or a journalist you will need to understand how to identify and find interesting stories that people will engage with.  We introduce you to working with sound, producing podcasts and radio programmes in our radio studios equipped with current industry-standard software.</p>
<p><strong>Real Stories<br></strong>You will develop further your research skills in identifying stories and interviewees in order to record, write and edit a video package to disseminate across several media. Possessing these skills will enable you to take part in making television programmes or in telling longer, more complex stories further on in your degree.</p>
<p><strong>Getting it out there!<br></strong>Content producers, whether it is for mainstream television, internet productions or professional newsrooms, are increasingly adopting a 'digital first' approach to publication, meaning that they consider their web content and presence before concerning themselves with the printed page or TV or radio output. This unit aims to give you a head-start in terms of developing, producing and managing content for the digital environment.</p>
<p><strong>Narratives<br></strong>This unit enables you to undertake an individual three-minute narrative project that you devise, research, produce, direct and post-produce yourself for a specific audience. The project can be in any genre, e.g. factual, fiction, drama documentary, or experimental, but must be a piece of moving image work which has a clear narrative arc and is made on location.</p>
<p><strong>Media Futures<br></strong>This unit provides you with a historical overview of the development of television, journalism and other media. We will not only trace the development of different forms of media, but also look into different formats, audiences and their behaviours. A particular focus will be made on new and emergent media technologies and how they are changing professional media production practices and audience behaviours.</p>

                    <p>In your second year you will have the opportunity to work in the multi-camera television studio to make a scene from a TV soap or comedy sitcom. You will also work in groups to make a fiction or drama documentary production on location.</p>
<p><strong>Studio Production</strong><br>The use of the ‘studio’ environment in mainstream television production has been a staple of the industry – ‘mass-producing’ content within a controlled environment in an economic and managed way. It is important that as a content creator and producer you understand the function of and the way that a television studio works – how does a multi-camera team operate? How do you cut a ‘live’ programme? How does a studio director work? What does a floor manager do? Are there conventions that the environment dictates? How can this model of production inform the future developments of the independent online studio and its content?</p>
<p><strong>Location Production</strong><br>This unit introduces you to the processes and protocols that you will need for making a production on location. Working in groups in production roles you will develop an original fiction script or concept for a short film or comedy drama series for a specific audience. You will contribute to the development, pre-production, production and post-production of the project and will need to engage with re-purposing the finished film for distribution across different media platforms. You will be asked to develop a social media strategy to disseminate your finished work with the aim of generating ‘hits’ and developing an online audience.</p>
<p><strong>Story (Elective)</strong><br>The Story unit offers you the opportunity to explore storytelling for the screen, including structure, characterization, narration, dialogue, and formatting, and the opportunity to put these elements into practice by writing and developing your own short film or screenplay.</p>
<p><strong>Or</strong></p>
<p><strong> Production Specialisms (Elective)</strong><br> You will undertake a personal research project looking at and critically evaluating the work of a particular director, producer, camera operator or editor and how their careers have evolved. You will produce a short piece of practical work that reflects and demonstrates a range of techniques and skills that you have researched, for example you might choose to recreate a scene from a film of a chosen director or cinematographer, or experiment with editing techniques.</p>
<p><strong>TV, Media and Society</strong><br>This unit will introduce you to a range of cultural and social theories that have informed and shaped the production, consumption and studies of media content, including television, journalism, films, music, literature and radio. You’ll also learn how to use theoretical concepts to analyse and critique media texts and the impacts they have on society from different perspectives.</p>
<p><strong>Study Abroad (Optional)</strong><br>This optional unit will allow you to spend a period of time in an overseas educational institution. </p>

                    <p><strong>Environment</strong><br> You'll examine the relation of photography to environment, with a particular emphasis on space. Internal and external, urban and rural environments are an important feature of our cultural, social and political experience. This unit provides the opportunity to explore these ideas through the genres of documentary, architecture, landscape and street photography.</p>
<p><strong>Identity</strong><br>You'll explore the ways in which identity is expressed in photography. Identity is never a 'given' in a photograph, it's always a matter of construction and negotiation, and in this unit you’ll learn about how this works.</p>
<p><strong>Image Making</strong><br>After a basic introduction to a range of different methodologies, exploring the notions of the singular image, tableau, series and/or montage, you'll decide on the mode of production of your work. Your project can be realised in the studio, with the option to undertake set-builds; or on location, as appropriate to your concept. This will be a visual project with outputs such as a book, exhibition, installation, moving image, magazine, zine or online publication.</p>
<p><strong>Individual Project</strong><br>This concludes the first year and encourages you to reflect upon your progress so far, to consolidate your successes and begin to make work not defined by a set brief, but driven by personal research and exploration.</p>

Working alongside these sessions will be a series of related lectures.</p>
<p><strong>Moving Image</strong><br>Working individually or as a team, you will develop a film concept and style, while also establishing a timeline to organise the production of your video throughout the unit. You’ll be expected to situate your work within wider industrial, social and cultural developments. Alongside your practical work you’ll be supported with a series of lectures, seminars, workshops and visual practice tutorials.</p>
<p><strong>Storytelling</strong><br>You'll produce a substantial body of work reflecting upon your learning, creativity and individuality. You'll be encouraged to experiment, challenge your image making skills and produce a series of work that forms a coherent narrative. The story, and how you tell it, is up to you but should be considered and reflect upon your research into historical and contemporary practice in visual culture.</p>
<p><strong>Exposure: Positioning Practice</strong><br>This unit serves to consolidate your learning throughout year two and focuses attention on where your practice and career are heading in the short and long term.

                    <p>This year is about solving the problems of how to represent ideas in photography by thinking strategically.</p>
<p>Building on the critical introduction to photography practices and assumptions carried out in Year 1, we'll consider ways of appropriating, modifying, negotiating, challenging or replacing existing conventions of representation.</p>
<p>You’ll explore critical ideas that challenge the conventions of photographic practice. During this period, you’ll produce an exhibition and, through building links with industry, you’ll begin to locate an external context for your work. </p>
<p><strong>Photographic Communities</strong><br>This unit explores notions of practice-based community and photographic networks. It will help you to develop professional skills to navigate your career through a variety of complex social, political, economic and environmental systems. Photograph’s meaning is determined by the nature of the image, audience and context. How you position your practice defines its identity.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Approaches</strong><br>Considering the larger cultural and philosophical implications of photographs and their meaning, you’ll learn not only the core themes but also the boundaries of your discipline. You'll examine key aspects of a range photographic practices and theory, in relation to their historical origins.</p>
<p><strong>Vision and Knowledge<br></strong>This unit asks you to think critically about the ‘objectivity’ of photography. Many photographic practices, including documentary, survey, scientific, medical, forensic, anthropological and military all have at their core the idea that ‘seeing is believing.’ The implication here is that visual representation is equivalent to ‘knowledge’. However, the ‘meanings’ of representations are in fact often determined by the contexts in which they are produced and presented.</p>
<p><strong>Experimental Practice</strong><br>You will explore a range of processes, treatments and applications to push the boundaries of photography, and test the relationships between subject matter, treatment and audience.</p>
<p><strong>Study Abroad (optional)</strong><br>This optional unit is designed to broaden your educational experience and deepen your understanding of cultural diversity. It will enable you to study within a different cultural context and gain fresh perspectives.</p>

                    <p><strong>Investigating Beauty<br></strong>We start by examining how beauty images, focused through colour, texture and historical settings, can inform beauty images for now and the future. Researching influences on beauty imagery from the past, looking at style and lifestyle, movies and music, culture and heritage, art and interiors; all of which will support a creative and forward-thinking narrative for understanding beauty imagery.</p>
<p><strong>The Narrative of Beauty<br></strong>This unit investigates telling a story the end-customer wants to hear, communicating a concept, marketing ‘beauty and lifestyle’, combining technical expertise with creative flare. By taking a narrative starting point (song lyric, a real-life event or a direct inspiration point such as a city) and then storyboarding a creative response, you will explore the concept of pulling disparate threads together to create a cohesive, new entity. We will focus on your ability to bring a fresh eye and a new interpretation to style and beauty, using trend boards to communicate the initial idea before further development.</p>
<p><strong>The Context of Beauty<br></strong>“Beauty is in the eye of the beholder” - a truism in relation to <em>context</em>. The observer must be able to understand what you are communicating, however beautiful on the surface, it must ‘speak’ to the customer on a deeper level. To this end the context and positioning of your work gives it gravitas, commercial clout, a reason to actually exist and conviction underpinning the creative aspects. Beauty – be it men’s grooming for beards, or a tiny seasonal cosmetics capsule colour story, requires you to understand what the core brand message is, why you are coming up with a creative concept in response, and how that will benefit the product, the brand and sales.</p>
<p><strong>My Portfolio<br></strong>The aim of this unit, which spans the whole year, is to provide you with the technical practical skills in preparing you for a career as a make-up innovator and creative director. How make-up, as a tool, can be used from the conventional and classic shoot or look book through to a new innovative concept. To understand the technicalities and techniques of professional make-up, the practical basics on which to build and refine creative and technical innovations. To understand and investigate the diversity of make-up and its applications in fashion and style terms is vital.</p>

                    <p><strong>Creative Catwalk, Film and Performance<br></strong>This unit is about applying your understanding of the market to beauty in motion, film or performance. The balance of usage between still and moving image in the promotion of ‘Lifestyle and Beauty’ has never been more important. The behind-the-scenes interviews, the sound-bite, the documentary, the as-seen-on or the advert, offer opportunities to go beyond the static. From practical demonstrations through to <em>haute couture</em> beauty editorials, there are countless ways to embrace moving image and creative make-up and hair. In the ‘Creative Catwalk, Film &amp; Performance’ unit, you'll set out to create a short film, documentary of a live event or editorial, which takes creative make-up to the highest level.</p>
<p><strong>Brand Positioning<br></strong>This unit is about research, analysis and your deep understanding of the market and applying this understanding to branding and creative solutions. Imagine you were applying for the role of creative director at the brand of your dreams (this could be the same brand as in the Creative Catwalk unit).</p>
<p><strong>My Industry<br></strong>This unit is about gaining direct, insider understanding of the marketplace and your role within it. The unit will begin to prepare you for entry into industry and focuses on the practices and principles of the creative industries surrounding creative make-up and hair design. It will introduce you to professional environments through consideration of expectations regarding internships, your rights as a worker, ethical concerns and how to academically frame your placement in relation to your future goals.</p>

                    <p>The first year is designed to challenge your understanding of Interior Architecture and Design. Projects introduce ways of recognising the relationships between the human body and the built environment, considering how your work impacts upon people and beginning to understand your social responsibilities as a designer.</p>
<p>You'll be taught alongside students of BA (Hons) Architecture following a shared programme of study.</p>
<p>Year 1 allows familiarity with the teaching and learning methods used across the course and the facilities available on campus.</p>
<p>By the end of the year, you'll have gained the depth of knowledge to complete and present a simple design programme drawing on a variety of cultural and technical influences and data sources. And you'll have utilised several techniques for communication as well as appreciated their cultural significance.</p>
<p><strong>Projects 01</strong><br> You'll explore fundamental issues, processes, skills and tools that will be relevant in your studies in architecture, focusing on design in relation to the human body. You'll explore the role of architecture in defining our spaces and experiences, as a means by which the body might be guided through site-specific design proposals.</p>
<p><strong>Projects 02</strong><br> The content and themes of the previous unit will be synthesised through the design of a small building. You'll be encouraged to think about the way in which all journeys are articulated through space and time. You'll also consider the activities of users in your design projects, as forms of journey that suggest particular sequencings and programming of spaces.</p>
<p><strong>Communication</strong><br> This unit introduces you to representation as a critical practice. An understanding of the status of modes and techniques of representation in analysis and design development will be of central importance. You'll learn a range of techniques in the context of a number of projects, supported by lectures and seminars, which will provide cultural and technological contexts for your production.</p>
<p><strong>Technology</strong><br> Through the use of materials, the unit introduces you to some aspects of technology associated with the built environment and to their relationships with design as both a process and an outcome.</p>
<p><strong>Cultural context 01</strong><br> This unit explores the study of the histories and theories of architectural and spatial design, aiming to address the ways in which designed spaces, buildings and cities are situated culturally and providing you with the tools of analysis and interpretation needed to make informed readings of your environment.</p>

<p>You’ll develop your knowledge of materials and fabrication processes through the design, representation and construction of an element in a site-specific location.</p>
<p>You’ll also develop your own design brief around issues of conservation.</p>
<p>Design projects will be delivered within a design studio system, with teaching given to groups of approximately 15 students. Each group is led by a member of staff and is explicitly informed by their design practice/research.</p>
<p><strong>Projects 03</strong><br> We'll introduce you to ways of understanding the relationships between the subjective idea (representation) and the physical process of making and installing the idea (realisation). We'll discuss processes, theories and methodologies of fabrication.</p>
<p><strong>Projects 04<br></strong>You'll look at the concept of design activism and develop this to a 'design as activism' agenda. You'll articulate a critical political position in relation to a site and context for the project. This will usually be selected by the studio group and often relates to live projects or sites that teaching staff are involved with.</p>
<p><strong>Creative Practice</strong><br> This unit is designed to provide an overview of the range of professional practices, established and emergent, within the field of interiors. You'll be introduced to a range of topics: business (including marketing and advertising), economics, law and legal, management, media, systems and operations, design strategies, and professional conduct. This is in addition to a series of talks related around the RIBA stages as they apply to interiors: pre-agreement, ideas-design, pre-construction, and construction and completion.</p>
<p><strong>Cultural Context 02</strong><br> This unit is chiefly concerned with theory, specifically the ways in which (design) theories have been made operational through (design) propositions.</p>

					<p>Our highly technical Industrial Design course at UCA Canterbury will give you the skills to design and produce innovative and exciting products.
<br><br>With access to our extensive workshop facilities – from 3D digital design software, laser cutting, CNC technology and virtual reality and spatial tracking technology – you’ll have plenty of exciting opportunities to design and create prototypes of your work.
<br><br>You’ll explore the manufacturing process from beginning to end, with an emphasis on design, and even challenge the definition of modern industrial design. The transferable skills that you’ll gain on this course will include making prototypes, presenting concepts to investors and developing a scientific understanding of materials and their interaction.
<br><br>You’ll graduate with a wealth of knowledge and experience, ready to enter a variety of industries that have a production element – working on anything from cars to furniture, toys or electronic devices, or in printmaking, 3D printing and more.</p>

                <div class=""content-title"">Year one</div>
                <div class=""content"">
                    <p>In the first year, you'll learn idea pitching and presentation, generating ideas and enhancing visual skills.</p>
<p>You’ll undertake contextual studies, exploring companies such as LEGO and the challenges of mass-production, and build and make your first prototypes.</p>
<p><strong>Creative Thinking</strong><br>You'll be introduced to a range of core skills in concept development, and representation, through sketching, model making, diagramming, and time-based media by engaging with a series of design projects aimed at provoking a response to a design ‘problem’. You'll be encouraged to use digital tools to record and reflect upon the design process.</p>
<p><strong>Context &amp; History</strong><br>You'll be introduced to historical and current contexts relating to industrial design, making and crafting culture. You'll learn how to use research to drive practice and will produce structured narratives in a range of media, exploring the ways in which design has impacted culture and vice versa. This unit is delivered through a series of lectures and research seminars. The unit runs alongside the Industrial Design 01 unit so that the two combine to provide a broad introduction to both the practical design development process and the historical context of design practice.</p>
<p><strong>Tooling</strong><br>You'll work through analogue and digital tooling processes to explore the iterative steps of making across a range of scales and materials. You'll become familiar with specific qualities of materials and how they might be formed, crafted or otherwise manipulated through the development of bespoke tools. You'll also make use of software to develop tool design ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Industrial Design 01</strong><br>You'll explore the fundamental processes of industrial design practice through product analysis, deconstruction, documentation and augmentation. You'll develop a range of skills to aid you in this analysis process, such as sketching and drawing, assembly / disassembly, accurate measurement in 3D space, material analysis and documentation of both the physical product and its intended market.</p>
<p><strong>Embedded Systems</strong><br>In Embedded Systems you build on your understanding of material systems but expand it into the realm of fabrication and adaptation. You learn about “adaptive re-use” for electromechanical systems and are encouraged to locate and acquire low voltage devices, toys or other systems which exhibit interesting or useful properties such as the conversion of rotational force to linear actuation, or systems with sensors or triggers. These systems are usually very well designed and can provide an excellent learning experience for understanding mechanical or electrical systems through reverse engineering. You'll develop new functions for these devices by utilising rapid fabrication to manufacture bespoke components.</p>

                    <p>In the second year, you'll share a unit with the BSc (Hons) Creative Computing course, alongside encouraged collaboration with the School of Architecture.</p>
<p><strong>Industrial Design 02</strong><br>This unit follows on from Industrial Design 01 and further enhances your skill set in design development and conceptualisation. Your core skills of sketching, model making, and visualisation will be further refined through a series of design projects. You'll also develop rigorous research practices, carefully examining the relationships between product, brand, user experience and form, and respond to this research through your design proposals.</p>
<p><strong>Context &amp; Theory</strong><br>This unit follows on from Context and History. You'll further develop your skills in academic research and producing a structured narrative. Working in a research team, you will build an understanding of human centred design and design thinking, and their implications for industrial design. You'll reflect upon and analyse the philosophical and practical underpinnings of these development methodologies.</p>
<p><strong>CoLAB 01 (Diverse Practice)</strong><br>In CoLAB 01 (Diverse Practice) you will develop your creative practice and your business skills, as you learn about business management, project planning, pitching, tendering and fees.</p>
<p><strong>Fabricate</strong><br>This unit immerses you in the world of fabrication and making. You'll gain further software skills in 3D digital design software for rapid prototyping, as well as hardware and health and safety knowledge on the use of laser cutting, 3D printing and Computer Numeric Control (CNC) technology. The unit builds on the knowledge you gained in the Embedded Systems unit. You'll learn to integrate analogue and digital fabrication technologies, to realise large scale materially appropriate, spatial interventions.</p>
<p><strong>Study Abroad (optional)</strong><br>This optional unit will allow you to spend a period of time in an overseas educational institution. </p>

                    <p><strong>Environment</strong><br> You'll examine the relation of photography to environment, with a particular emphasis on space. Internal and external, urban and rural environments are an important feature of our cultural, social and political experience. This unit provides the opportunity to explore these ideas through the genres of documentary, architecture, landscape and street photography.</p>
<p><strong>Styling Identity</strong><br>You'll extend your knowledge of creative fashion styling, identity and image creation practice from a theoretical and practical perspective. This unit aims to use and explore various approaches to research, and empower you in the complex process of analysing a more diverse range of sources and interpreting your findings in a wider range of outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Image Making</strong><br>After a basic introduction to a range of different methodologies, exploring the notions of the singular image, tableau, series and/or montage, you'll decide on the mode of production of your work. Your project can be realised in the studio, with the option to undertake set-builds; or on location, as appropriate to your concept. This will be a visual project with outputs such as a book, exhibition, installation, moving image, magazine, zine or online publication.</p>
<p><strong>Individual Project</strong><br>This concludes the first year and encourages you to reflect upon your progress so far, consolidate your successes and begin to make not defined by a set brief but driven by personal research and exploration.</p>

                    <p><strong>Photo-Object</strong><br> The Photo-Object unit encourages you to consider the relationship between photography and objects. This basic premise will be explored through a series of workshops focusing on the composition, lighting and layering of objects, within both studio and external settings. Working alongside these sessions will be a series of related lectures.</p>
<p><strong>Fashion Film</strong><br>Working as part of a team (or individually if you wish) you'll use story and mood-boards to develop a fashion film concept and style, then establish timelines to help organise production and meet deadlines, from finding actors/models, scouting locations, shooting and editing audio-visual footage, to post-production and promotion of your work. You'll be guided along the way by workshops, which twill encourage you to experiment with new techniques and learn to create technically proficient and visually exciting audio-visual work. You’ll be expected to locate your work within wider industrial, social and cultural developments, potentially culminating in the showcasing of your film.</p>
<p><strong>Storytelling</strong><br>You'll produce a substantial body of work reflecting upon your learning, creativity and individuality. You'll be encouraged to experiment, challenge your image making skills and produce a series of work that forms a coherent narrative. The story, and how you tell it, is up to you but should be considered and reflect upon your research into historical and contemporary practice in visual culture.</p>
<p><strong>Exposure: Positioning Practice</strong><br>This unit serves to consolidate your learning throughout year two and focuses attention on where your practice and career are heading in the short and long term. It is designed to synthesise understanding of your practice with regard to the dissemination of work, possible directions you might take in year three, and consideration of where you might want to work within the creative industries.</p>

Professional practices, visual merchandising and fashion forecasting are the focus for this creative and experiential year. You may also have the opportunity to complete an industry work placement, study abroad and join us on a trip to New York.</p>
<p><strong>Forecasting and Fashion Futures</strong><br> This unit emphasises how fashion is driven by a constant need to predict future trends, across strategic industry sectors, including product development as well as retail and marketing. Trend forecasting provides colour material and style insights, yet conventional roles of the physical store and the high street are evolving and digital marketing is replacing more traditional approaches.</p>
<p><strong>Visual Merchandising and Experiential Retailing<br></strong>Visual Merchandising involves the development of significant selling concepts which impact on, and embrace the whole ‘consumer experience’, from the design of the floor plan and retail space design, to the ‘look’ of the mannequins, store windows, fixtures and fittings and the way in which consumers interface with the brand and physical space. This unit introduces the role and theories of visual merchandising for fashion, from creative concept development to resolution and client presentation.</p>
<p><strong>Professional Practice and Industry Placement</strong><br> This unit is self-initiated and will involve you taking a legitimate industry placement opportunity, regarded by you and your unit leader as an appropriate and unique professional experience. Prior to going on placement you'll have the opportunity for self-diagnosis in respect of your interests, strengths, weaknesses and career ambitions. You'll participate in mock interviews, appreciate assertiveness and negotiation and complete your professional CV in preparation for your industry placement.</p>

					<p>With an international reputation for producing talented graduates working at the highest levels of the fashion industry, our Fashion Atelier course at UCA Rochester gives you the chance to produce hand-crafted and bespoke high fashion.
<br><br>You’ll develop specialist technical skills in draping, creative pattern-cutting, machine and hand-sewing techniques and the specific creative skills and expertise needed for bespoke tailoring, couture-inspired fashion and contemporary design for the modern wardrobe.
<br><br>You’ll use industry-standard facilities to expand your skills and explore your craft, with support from a team of highly skilled staff and visiting practitioners who will help you develop a range of tangible and transferable skills with real industry value.
<br><br>As well as practical learning, there will also be the opportunity to undertake a work placement that strengthens your CV and prepares you for your career after graduation.</p>
                  
                  </div>","<li class=""split-content-item"">
                <div class=""content-title"">Year 1</div>
                <div class=""content"">
                    <p>The first year introduces and develops core Atelier skills through the concept of design realisation. You'll learn specialist techniques in draping and creative pattern cutting, as well as production and finishing techniques through increasingly complex outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>A Question of Angles and Curves</strong><br> Your first unit is an introduction through critical analysis and review to the concept of transferring 2-dimensional cloth into 3-dimensional garments utilising geometric shapes. The investigation of basic shapes: squares, circles and triangles will enable you to explore creativity through a clear, simple and edited format. Scale, construction, repetition and fabric will all transform the geometric element into creative garment outcomes. At the initial starting point, design realisation through both 2-D flat cutting and 3-D stand work will introduce you to the concept of creative draping and cutting as the main design vehicle, as opposed to designing on paper.</p>
<p><strong>Form and Silhouette</strong><br> Understanding the relationship between the fit, the hang and the balance of the finished garment relates to the successful alignment of the correct pattern shape to the correct body shape with the correct fabric selection. In order for you to successfully align all these elements, you will be taught the essential technical disciplines as well as the creative principles. In this unit you will be expected to start to explore in a creative and analytical way, the way in which dart manipulation can enhance both the silhouette and the 3-dimensional form of a garment, (long top or dress). This is in conjunction with the understanding of style lines within a garment. </p>
<p><strong>Sleeves and Collars</strong><br> The shoulder line and the armhole are vital focus areas for silhouette and creative cut. In this unit you'll explore the range of developments within the sleeve area of creative cut, with in-depth focus on both the set of the armhole and the shaping of the sleeve itself. Collars and cuffs will also feature as an area of focus, where pattern drafting and modeling techniques will be taught and applied to a range of styles. This unit is also about teamwork and you will work in small groups to produce and promote your skills across a range of final garments.</p>
<p><strong>Contour and Structure<br></strong>Contour and structure are key aspects in the successful creation of an evening dress, through an understanding of construction methods in relation to the silhouette. Occasion wear dresses for events such as a reception, party, through to a full gala ball gown or red carpet award dress, requires two very specific creative cutting areas of expertise and a specialist series of techniques. In this unit we will focus on the fitted and strapless boned bodice.</p>
<p><strong>Fashion History and Theory<br></strong>This unit will establish a foundation for the evaluation and discussion of fashion, dress and textiles, which underpins practice in the your main pathway. It will draw on seminal works and the latest academic research to explore the  historical, cultural, social and economic significance of sartorial fashion. In so doing you will gain an understanding of fashion in a variety of contexts, both historically and theoretically.</p>

                <div class=""content"">
                    <p>You'll build on your skills and truly develop your specialist practice in your second year through a focus on bespoke tailoring and couture-inspired 'soft' sewing for contemporary fashion. You'll further develop your draping, pattern construction, fabric manipulation and handcraft sewing and finishing techniques, as well as advanced design communication skills.</p>
<p><strong>The Tailoring Atelier: Craft and Heritage</strong><br> This unit focuses on developing your ability to use informed research, applied to cut, fit, balance and attention to detail in order to achieve contemporary tailored garments that reference a precision and demonstrate an understanding of tradition. Through the realisation of tailored garments, you will therefore learn to understand and work with the influence and implications of heritage to inform craft skills which have evolved over centuries.</p>
<p><strong>Professional Preparation: Industry Placement</strong><br> This unit aims to prepare you for both your third year and your future career. You will select one of the following options: <br><br>Option 1: Industry Placement: this option enables you to undertake a five-week self-initiated work placement that is relevant to your potential career direction and contributes to the fulfilment of the course aims and objectives. <br><br>Option 2: Industry case study: this option offers the opportunity to study an aspect of the industry that you have identified as an area of interest. Through the method of case study research you will undertake fieldwork into a self-selected topic or question. </p>
<p><strong>The Flou Atelier</strong><br> The French haute couture workrooms use the term 'le flou', meaning softly sewn garments with a fluid handle to them. This unit focuses on the 'soft sewing' where traditionally crepe de chine, georgette, mousseline, lace and other fragile/unstructured fabrics are used. Specialist draping, fabric manipulation and finishing techniques will play a key role in this unit.</p>
<p><strong>Developing Research and Critical Enquiry</strong><br> This unit provides space to consider the research and inquiry options available to you in the final year, and evaluate your future direction. Through exploration of a subject area related to either broader contextual issues, or a concern within the industry you aspire to work in, you will develop appropriate research skills applicable to your final year of study.</p>
<p><strong>Design Concepts &amp; Contexts<br></strong>This unit introduces you to a range of cultural and critical theories and design contexts and concepts that are vital for developing a broader contextual understanding that underpin your main pathway and future contextual studies units. The unit will explore significant movements and moments in the history of design and the arts in order to help students develop a widening appreciation of the aesthetic forces, which shape culture and potentially your own work.</p>
<p><strong>Study Abroad (optional)</strong><br> This optional unit will allow you to spend a period of time in an overseas educational institution. </p>

					<p>In an industry where designers and makers are expected to be all-rounders who can work with a wide range of professionals, you’ll learn how to create dynamic environments, costumes and props on our BA (Hons) Design for Theatre and Screen course at UCA Rochester.
<br><br>You’ll learn all the essential design, making and technical skills you’ll need in your career, and put those skills into practice as you take part in work placements and exciting collaborative projects, such as working with TV Production students at Maidstone Television Studios.
<br><br>You’ll also gain a deeper understanding of the discipline, learning about the history and theory of theatre and film arts, underpinned by art and design history.</p>

                <div class=""content-title"">Year one</div>
                <div class=""content"">
                    <p>Your first year offers tutor-led instruction to the role and responsibility of the designer. Projects include text analysis, introduction to designing a scale model for a theatre or screen-based performance, and establishing industry standard processes for designing. The emphasis is on establishing a secure foundation upon which future projects will rely, as well as an opportunity to develop a distinctive visual design language through costume and set design. Alongside this, students learn key skills in costume and prop making, including hand sewing and machine sewing, woodwork, metalwork, digital manipulation and technical drawing, amongst other skills.</p>
<p><strong>Visual Narrative One<br></strong>This unit challenges students to create individual responses to a given text through ‘anticipating a performance’, by way of set and costume design. You will be introduced to how knowledge and research supports creative thinking and design development, through a combination of text analysis, contextual research, discussion, observation, storyboard, 2D and 3D speculative enquiry.</p>
<p><strong>Visual Narrative Two<br></strong>Designing for theatre or screen is a collaborative professional discipline: designers work with directors and makers to deliver dramatic impact, whether for theatre or screen. This unit introduces team-working and a range of approaches, methods and techniques where creative manipulation promotes dramatic storytelling, and develops important skills involved in creating a visual language for screen or stage, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing atmospheric environments</li>
<li>Theatre and stage craft</li>
<li>Manipulating material and form to support a narrative</li>
<li>Dramatic impact through the five elements of design.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Toolbox<br></strong>You'll be given a practical induction into the workshop environments for the course, providing you with the opportunity to develop a ‘toolbox’ of skills needed for the design and fabrication of set models, costume, application of craft skills. Using traditional and contemporary techniques in a workshop-based environment, the unit establishes students’ skills and ability to identify appropriate methods for the creation of a range of bespoke scenic elements. You are provided with working knowledge of processes, materials and techniques which are regarded as industry standard. The unit engages students in understanding the position of the designer-maker as a practitioner in the performance industry. The unit also introduces you to digital skill applications.</p>
<p><strong>Cultural Contexts 1<br></strong>You'll be introduced to the histories, theories and practices that inform contemporary performance and production design. It explores the ways in which art history, contemporary art, cultural studies and the wider world influences designers. The unit provides you with the tools for research, analysis and interpretation to make informed readings of scenographic and filmic spaces. It examines the ways in which stories can be told through images, objects and spaces, and the ways in which audiences receive and interact with this information.</p>

                    <p>Second-year project work includes embracing current socio-political issues, and establishing in-depth processes for designing and making in response to a contemporary theatre or screen-based text. Projects are structured to replicate industry practice in working to a deadline, and you’ll get your first taste of industry through work experience and professional collaborations. Year two also includes work experience and professional collaborations, supporting insight to industry working practices, networking and key skill development for your employability.</p>
<p><strong>Visual Narrative Three<br></strong>Through reference to a contemporary theatre or screen-based text, this unit deepens the process of analysis and research, in support of a design for a theatre or film piece which speaks of contemporary socio-political contexts. Through a pre-production design process, and its likely consequence from page to stage, the unit gives the opportunity to develop dynamic designs relating to the visual languages in current design practices for theatre and screen.</p>
<p><strong>Cultural Contexts 2<br></strong>You'll develop your understanding of the critical and theoretical ideas that emerged in the 20th century within the context of modernity. We'll seek to engage you in criticism and theory via research, seminars, lectures, tutorials and self-determined analytical studies. Through the examination of current critical perspectives on contemporary art, design, film and performance, the unit will prepare you to contextualise your own design practice. </p>
<p><strong>Visual Narrative Four<br></strong>Through in-depth approaches to working with specialist making practice, this unit enables you as designer-maker to develop a specific yet wide-ranging skill-set, with the aim to deliver a design within a functional and practical format.</p>
<p><strong>Professional and Collaborative Practice<br></strong>Working with practitioners in the performance design profession can give exciting and valuable experience in areas of industry practice that help prepare students for life after graduation. This unit promotes the opportunity to engage with a range of work experiences and collaborations within the creative industries of theatre making, television production, filmmaking, workshop production and alternate forms of performance. The unit offers opportunities to experience industry working practices, networking and key skill development to enhance your employability.</p>
<p><strong>Study Abroad (optional)</strong><br> This optional unit will allow you to spend a period of time in an overseas educational institution.</p>

					<p>Begin your journey to become a qualified architect on our fully validated and accredited BA (Hons) Architecture course at UCA Canterbury.
<br><br>Our course offers a lively, progressive and creative experience, and you’ll be designing new buildings and considering the world around you from the get-go.
<br><br>We offer you dedicated studios, a wealth of technology and apparatus to learn and master, and you’ll have the use of our Tracklab virtual reality studio.
<br><br>On this in-depth course, you’ll be challenged to become highly skilled in technical drawing and design. You’ll also be pushed to consider how architecture can have a wider impact on everything, from its immediate surroundings, to social contexts, right through to the human body.</p>

                <div class=""content-title"">Year one</div>
                <div class=""content"">
                    <p>The first year comprises five units, exploring design, communication techniques, history and theory. You will also be introduced to new software and at the end of the year, design a small building.</p>
<p><strong>Projects 01</strong><br>You'll look at fundamental issues, processes, skills and tools that will be relevant in your studies in architecture, focusing on design in relation to the human body. The role of architecture in defining our spaces and experiences is explored as a means by which the body might be guided through site-specific design proposals.</p>
<p><strong>Communication 01</strong><br>This unit introduces you to representation as a critical practice. You'll learn a range of techniques in the context of a number of projects, supported by lectures and seminars. These will provide cultural and technological contexts.</p>
<p><strong>Technology 01</strong><br>Through the use of materials, the unit examines aspects of technology associated with the built environment. It will also explore their relationship with design as both a process and an outcome.</p>
<p><strong>Cultural Context 01</strong><br>This unit looks at the study of the histories and theories of architectural and spatial design. It aims to address the ways in which designed spaces, buildings and cities are situated culturally. It also provides you with the required tools of analysis and interpretation to make informed readings of your environment.</p>
<p><strong>Projects 02</strong><br>The content and themes of the previous unit are synthesised through the design of a small building, focusing on relationships between architecture and time. Whilst the first half of the unit focuses on site analysis, research and design strategy, the second focuses on lighting, structure, materiality and finish.</p>

                    <p>There’s six units across the second year, which will challenge you to experiment, explore and test theories, designs and materials. The potential for specialised learning and the implications of different choices of direction will become clearer, with personal preferences emerging.</p>
<p><strong>Projects 03</strong><br>You'll focus on the ways in which architecture can establish social, political, physical and environmental dialogues with wider, as well as immediate, conditions. The importance of identifying and then developing or suppressing these relationships consciously through the design of external space will be interrogated.</p>
<p><strong>Cultural Context 02</strong><br>The unit, entitled Design, Theories and Operations, considers how ideas are socially, historically and culturally located. It is primarily concerned with theory and represents a step up, challenging you to interrogate architectural ideas, designs and actions. You’ll engage with, and make explicit, theories which are shaping the built environment, or can be used to develop a more nuanced critique of its production. </p>
<p><strong>Technology 02</strong><br>This unit explores the coverage of building materials and methods of construction introduced in Year One. It introduces low energy design strategies as a vehicle to discussing sustainability in the built environment.</p>
<p><strong>Projects 04</strong><br>Has two themes:</p>
<p><strong>Intelligent skin:</strong> You will be introduced to a design methodology with a technology focus, providing you with the opportunity to use technology as a generator for an engagement with cultural objectives, contextual study and communication through design development.<br><strong>Synoptic:</strong> You’ll undertake a synoptic project where the main emphasis is on the integration of different design preoccupations and resolving these together to present a well-considered outcome. Typically, the project set will be concerned with a manufacturing process of current social or aesthetic concern or interest.</p>
<p><strong>Communication 02</strong><br> You’ll look in more detail at how computers, which allow simultaneous working on a variety of resolutions and modes, have broadened possibilities. You'll also be introduced to parametric digital design.</p>
<p><strong>Creative Practice 01</strong><br> This unit is designed to provoke experimentation, risk-taking, exploratory and playful work following the rigours of professional practice and the creative industries.</p>
<p><strong>Study Abroad (optional)</strong><br> This optional unit will allow you to spend a period of time in an overseas educational institution. </p>

<p><strong>Research and Concept</strong><br>Following the Short Film unit, you’ll get feedback on your work. This feedback, together with tutorials, will identify your strengths, areas of improvement and interests to take forward into an individual course of study. Your research may include expanding your existing technical skills or experimenting with new techniques and to this end, you will examine a wide range of approaches to animation production. </p>
<p><strong>Advanced Digital Techniques</strong><br>Through a series of seminars and workshops, you’ll look beyond the tools of computer software and explore their creative use within the context of your own animated sequences. You’ll go on to work in small production teams, where roles and responsibilities reflect that of industry practice. Each team will produce an animated piece using a combination of 2D and 3D software.</p>
<p><strong>Animated Cultures</strong><br>Exploring the diverse cultures of animation through key debates and the work of key practitioners, you will explore technological, social and aesthetic innovations in relevant critical contexts. You will also consider animation’s wider contexts in moving image, media culture and the visual arts.</p>
<p><strong>Study Abroad (optional)</strong><br>This optional unit will allow you to spend a period of time in an overseas educational institution.</p>

					<p>The Foundation Diploma in Art, Design &amp; Media Practice is the perfect course to take after your A-Levels if you’re looking to progress onto a degree in any creative subject.
<br><br>This year-long course will help you improve your skills and knowledge across a wide range of art and design subjects, preparing you for your chosen degree or helping you decide which course to study. You’ll build a strong portfolio of work before you start your degree, so you can hit the ground running and realise your full potential.
<br><br>The first part of your year will be spent investigating different areas of art and design, identifying your strengths and personal interests to help you grow as an artist or designer. As the year progresses, you’ll have more freedom to specialise and direct your route through the course, resulting in an exhibition of your work at the end of the year and a unique and varied portfolio, ready for your undergraduate degree.
<br><br>You’ll have access to the facilities at UCA Rochester and will be supported by teams of subject specialist lecturers – most lecturers are active within their own fields as professional designers, artists and researchers.
<br><br>Working in and amongst our undergraduate and postgraduate students as part of our uniquely creative community, you’ll be able to observe first-hand the range of degree options available to you.
<br><br>As a foundation student at UCA, you’ll be on campus for at least three days a week with your own dedicated studio space. If you’re expected to be studying English and/or Maths as part of your programme, you’ll attend for longer, see the course details for further information.
<br><br>On successful completion of the Foundation Diploma you’ll have a direct entry route onto the full range of our undergraduate degree programmes at UCA via our Diploma 2 Degree scheme. (You’ll need a Pass for most courses, or a Merit if you wish to progress onto BA (Hons) Architecture.)
<br><br>We’ll arrange visits to all our campuses and give you the opportunity to undertake workshops in several different areas so you can make an informed decision that’s right for you.

					<p>The Foundation Diploma in Art, Design &amp; Media Practice is the perfect course to take after your A-Levels if you’re looking to progress onto a degree in any creative subject.
<br><br>This year-long course will help you improve your skills and knowledge across a wide range of art and design subjects, preparing you for your chosen degree or helping you decide which course to study. You’ll build a strong portfolio of work before you start your degree, so you can hit the ground running and realise your full potential.
<br><br>The first part of your year will be spent investigating different areas of art and design, identifying your strengths and personal interests to help you grow as an artist or designer. As the year progresses, you’ll have more freedom to specialise and direct your route through the course, resulting in an exhibition of your work at the end of the year and a unique and varied portfolio, ready for your undergraduate degree.
<br><br>You’ll have access to the facilities at UCA Farnham and will be supported by teams of subject specialist lecturers – most lecturers are active within their own fields as professional designers, artists and researchers.
<br><br>Working in and amongst our undergraduate and postgraduate students as part of our uniquely creative community, you’ll be able to observe first-hand the range of degree options available to you.
<br><br>As a foundation student at UCA, you’ll be on campus for at least three days a week with your own dedicated studio space. If you’re expected to be studying English and/or Maths as part of your programme, you’ll attend for longer, see the course details for further information.
<br><br>On successful completion of the Foundation Diploma you’ll have a direct entry route onto the full range of our undergraduate degree programmes at UCA via our Diploma 2 Degree scheme. (You’ll need a Pass for most courses, or a Merit if you wish to progress onto BA (Hons) Architecture.)
<br><br>We’ll arrange visits to all our campuses and give you the opportunity to undertake workshops in several different areas so you can make an informed decision that’s right for you. We’ll also help you with your application – there’s no need to apply through UCAS and there will be no selection interview for progression onto your chosen degree.

					<p>If you’re returning to education and looking for a part-time art and design course, then the Access to Higher Education Diploma – Art &amp; Design at UCA Epsom is the perfect springboard to a degree course, a career change or progression in your existing career. 
<br><br>Specifically tailored to those entering education after a break, our Access Diploma in Art &amp; Design gives you the chance to explore a range of art and design subjects, whilst balancing other work or family commitments. 
<br><br>Open to anyone over 19 years of age, you’ll study with us for two days a week at our Epsom campus, normally experimenting in five disciplines – Fine Art, Fashion and Textiles, 3D Design, Lens-based Media and Visual Communications.
<br><br>On this course you’ll develop or rediscover the skills and confidence needed for the art and design world. You’ll be supported by individual tutorials, educational visits, a range of lectures, and opportunities to partake in live briefs and competitions.
<br><br>All staff members teaching this course are either active practitioners or involved in research in their specialist fields, offering you a great opportunity to build relationships and learn directly from experts.
<br><br>Our Access Diploma is fully integrated with the other pre-degree and foundation diploma courses at the Epsom campus – so you’ll be working within a wider creative community where you can share ideas, techniques and project concepts.
<br><br>Throughout your studies you’ll have your own dedicated studio space, as well as access to the same facilities as an undergraduate or postgraduate student.</p>
