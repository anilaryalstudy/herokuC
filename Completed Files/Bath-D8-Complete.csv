Through problem-based learning, you'll critically apply mathematical, scientific and engineering knowledge to projects. A mix of practical work in laboratories and theory in lectures and seminars gives you the breadth of learning needed to become adept in the subject. You’ll also develop transferable skills such as problem solving, teamwork and resource management. Integrating these with your technical knowledge, you’ll learn how to tackle complex, and often open-ended, engineering problems. Individual and group projects are a chance for you to develop scientific ideas from bench scale to process scale.","<div class=""flex-wrapper pinned-items text-only action-list"">

We’ve designed a bespoke course to prepare mechanical engineers for the electrification of their sector.Your studies will focus on the design, performance, and operation of automotive powertrains and vehicle systems. We’ll teach you about electrical components, and their mechanical contexts and constraints. This means you’ll understand both the fundamental principles of batteries, power electronics, and motors, as well as how to integrate these into a system. By the end of your course, you should be able to analyse vehicle requirements to design and specify different types of propulsion systems.","<div class=""flex-wrapper pinned-items text-only action-list"">

This course is for you if you’re keen to learn about current AI technologies and would like to specialise in this field from the start of your degree, whilst still gaining a grounding in broader computer science.In the first year, you’ll learn the basics of computer science, including mathematics and programming skills, along with an introduction to the theory and practice of AI. In the second year, you’ll continue to develop your AI skills, with a focus on machine learning. In the final year, you’ll choose optional units alongside an individual project that will allow you to specialise in a specific area of AI. You can specialise in areas such as robotics, natural language processing, intelligent agents, and computer vision. You’ll regularly meet with an academic who’s an expert in your chosen field.","<div class=""flex-wrapper pinned-items text-only action-list"">
